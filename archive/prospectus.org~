read Skyrms, Higher Order Degrees of Belief

Lagrange multipliers and the Radon-Nikodym Theorem

impossible event contains infinite information: I(omega) = 0, I(empty
set) = +inf

Bayesian assumptions (Deb Mayo, Wolfgang Spohn, Halpern, Wagner)

Prior probabilities

The detractors: Carnap, Jeffrey, van Fraassen, Judy Benjamin, Shimony,
Seidenfeld, Wagner (see Spohn, 197), epistemic entrenchment (Douven

ranking theory), Caticha and Giffin, Jaynes
