Many Bayesian epistemologists now accept that it is not necessary for a rational agent to hold sharp credences. There are various compelling formal theories how such a non-traditional view of credences can accommodate decision-making and updating. They are motivated by a common complaint: that sharp credences can fail to represent incomplete evidence. I show that the critical response of those who want to maintain the traditional view with only sharp credences is insufficient. Their criticism, however, opens the door to semantic questions which make indeterminate credences vulnerable on a much deeper level. This paper uses both conceptual arguments and hands-on examples to demonstrate that rational agents should always have sharp credences.  It is also articulated and substantiated that agents with indeterminate credal states make long term gains betting against agents with sharp credences. This on the surface inconvenient fact can be explained and does not favour indeterminacy over sharp credences.
