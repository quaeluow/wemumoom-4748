Many Bayesian epistemologists now accept that it is not necessary for a rational agent to hold sharp credences. There are various compelling formal theories how such a non-traditional view of credences can accommodate decision making and updating. They are motivated by a common complaint: that sharp credences can fail to represent incomplete evidence and exaggerate the information contained in it. Indeterminate credal states, the alternative to sharp credences, face challenges as well: they are vulnerable to dilation, under certain conditions do not permit learning, and provide a narrative about the relationship between precision and entropy that cannot be formalized. This paper focuses on two concessions that Thomas Augustin and James Joyce make to address these challenges. These concessions undermine the case for indeterminate credal states. I use both conceptual arguments and hands-on examples to demonstrate that rational agents always have sharp credences.

Moreover, it is articulated and substantiated that agents with indeterminate credal states make long term gains betting against agents with sharp credences. This on the surface inconvenient fact can be explained and does not favour indeterminate credences over sharp credences.

Many Bayesian epistemologists now accept that it is not necessary for a rational agent to hold sharp credences. There are various compelling formal theories how such a non-traditional view of credences can accommodate decision making and updating. They are motivated by a common complaint: that sharp credences can fail to represent incomplete evidence and exaggerate the information contained in it. I show that the critical response of those who want to maintain the traditional view with only sharp credences is insufficient. Their criticism, however, opens the door to semantic questions which make indeterminate credences vulnerable on a deeper level. This paper uses both conceptual arguments and hands-on examples to demonstrate that rational agents always have sharp credences. Moreover, it is articulated and substantiated that agents with indeterminate credal states make long term gains betting against agents with sharp credences. This on the surface inconvenient fact can be explained and does not favour indeterminate credences over sharp credences.
