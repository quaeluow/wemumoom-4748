I think a conjunction of the following is sometimes true:

(1) It is rational for S to believe X.

(2) It is rational for S to believe Y.

(3) It is not rational for S to believe X and Y.

Here is an example:

(1e) It is rational for me to believe that the tomato in front of me is red.

(2e) It is rational for me to believe that the tomato in front of me is orange.

(3e) It is not rational for me to believe that the tomato in front of me is red and that the tomato in front of me is orange.

Is my reasoning sound? Are there other examples?
