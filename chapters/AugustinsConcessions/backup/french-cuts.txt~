\texttt{<x1.1>}Sharp credences confront a genuine conceptual
crisis with intuitions about betting behaviour, completeness for
preferences, and how reasonable it is to demand precision from
agents, even if they are rational. Indeterminacy appears to
provide an elegant solution to overcome this crisis as well as a
powerful formal theory to uphold what many find so compelling
about the Bayesian legacy. In the face of these virtues, I
maintain that indeterminacy adds an unnecessary layer to the
semantics of partial belief which has in its wake
counter-intuitive consequences and solves nothing that cannot be
solved by a carefully articulated version of the classical
Bayesian commitment to sharp credences.\texttt{</x1.1>}
