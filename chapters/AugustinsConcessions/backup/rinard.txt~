I just read your paper, ``A Decision Theory for Imprecise
Probabilities.'' Very interesting. I have a few comments, for whatever
they're worth. 

I was very thankful that you addressed the question what a doxastic
state is and how it might be represented. I am working on this as
well, although I am coming down on the side of those who prefer sharp
credences. I wouldn't say that sharp credences ``represent'' doxastic
states; they only reflect them---the difference being that for
updating, drawing inferences, and making decisions it is often
necessary to use elements of the doxastic states that are not
contained in the ``credal state,'' i.e. sharp credences or
indeterminate credal states.

So, here is my first complaint: you say that ``a primary purpose of
the set of functions model is to represent the totality of the agent's
actual doxastic state.'' I don't think that the set of functions model
can deliver on this. James Joyce has a nice argument why not in his
2010 paper, which you cite. If the model could represent the totality
of the agent's doxastic state, Roger White's dilation problem would
become insurmountable for indeterminate credal states (the argument is
intricate: it has to do with admissibility in Lewis' principal
principle). 

Consequently, when you say in a footnote that according to Joyce,
``the interval alone may not constitute a complete characterization of
one's doxastic attitude towards H ... one's entire set of functions
may be needed for this,'' I suspect you are misrepresenting Joyce's
position. Convexity is not at issue here. No credal state (either a
sharp credence or an indeterminate credal state, whether convex or
not) can completely characterize a doxastic attitude. Joyce's
Three-Sided Die example on page 294 (2010) illustrates this.

That's it for complaints. I have been thinking about what you call
exportability in the last two weeks and couldn't develop a vocabulary
around it or think about it systematically, and, voila, here you are
with a fascinating account and how it draws the relevant distinctions
between the liberal and the moderate position. I will, if I may, use
this in my defence of sharp credences (I agree that Elga's objection
is not sustainable---it is Joyce's response to White that, in my
opinion, makes the imprecision argument collapse). There are a few
printing errors (``if and only there'' on page 6, ``must
fundamentally'' on page 9, ``if leaves open'' on page 12), but I
suppose it's too late to get those fixed.

Thank you for your work. I really enjoyed it.

Stefan
