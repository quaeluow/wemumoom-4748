\section{Synopsis} 
\label{Synopsis}

Traditional Bayesian epistemology used to include the requirement for
a rational agent to hold a sharp credence function. It has recently
become popular to drop this requirement. There are now Bayesian
theories which permit a rational agent to hold indeterminate credal
states based on incomplete or ambiguous evidence. I will refer to
Bayesians who continue to adhere to the classical theory of sharp
credences for rational agents as \qnull{Laplaceans} (e.g.\ Adam Elga
and Roger White). I will refer to Bayesians who do not believe in the
requirement for a rational agent to hold sharp credences as
\qnull{Booleans} (e.g.\ Peter Walley and James Joyce; see Boole, 1854,
chapters 16--21, for alternative methods to the ones suggested by
Laplace which result in imprecise epistemic probabilities).

After describing the appeal of indeterminacy and showing how
contemporary Laplacean objections fail, I will point to more serious
failings of indeterminacy in semantic terms and show how a proper
semantics of not knowing, which we could also call a semantics of
partial belief, solves the problems for sharp credences that Booleans
address by introducing indeterminate credal states. There is a sense
in which, by linking knowledge of chances to its reflection in
credences, Booleans seek to reconcile traditional knowledge
epistemology concerned with full belief and formal epistemology
concerned with partial belief. There are other more recent
reconciliation projects (see Spohn, 2012; and Moss, 2013), but if my
paper is correct then the Boolean approach will not contribute to this
reconciliation because it mixes full belief and partial belief
metaphors in ways that are semantically problematic.

A sharp credence, as much as the term suggests precision and a measure
of certainty, is a representation of an epistemic state chracterized
by uncertainty and lack of information. Importantly, it does not
represent the evidence which informs the epistemic state, and it makes
no claim of such a representation. Indeterminate credal states are
often lauded as doing much better representing uncertainty together
with the evidence that constrains it, but they can no more give an
adequate representation of evidence than sharp credences. This paper
is concerned with the semantic legitimacy of having a $0.5$ sharp
credence in heads for a coin of whose bias we are completely ignorant;
for a coin whose fairness is supported by a lot of evidence; and even
for a coin about whose bias we know to be either 1/3 or 2/3 for heads.

One potential Boolean claim is that agents who use indeterminate
credal states do better than Laplaceans when they bet on the truth of
events for which they have varying degrees of evidence. Peter Walley
gives an example where a Laplacean does much worse at predicting
soccer games than Boolean peers. I show that the result is due to an
unreasonable restriction on the betting behaviour of the Laplacean.
Once this restriction is lifted, Laplaceans do just as well as
Booleans, except that they are not tangled in the semantic problem of
the double task, where indeterminate credal states are supposed to
reflect both the uncertainty of an agent and other properties of her
evidence.

I will present several examples where this double task stretches
indeterminate credal states to the limits of plausibility, for example
when they need to aggregate expert opinion or account for dilation.
Joyce's idea that credences can represent balance, weight, and
specificity of the evidence is inconsistent with the use of
indeterminacy (and Joyce himself, in response to the dilation problem,
gives the argument why this is the case). The implicit Boolean claim
that certain properties of the evidence (its ambiguity, its
completeness, conflicts within it) can be recovered from indeterminate
credal states is inconsistent with an effective Boolean answer to the
dilation problem.

The Laplacean approach of assigning subjective probabilities to
partitions of the event space (e.g.\ objective chances) and then
aggregating them by David Lewis's summation formula into a single
precise credence function is semantically tidy and shares many of the
formal virtues of Boolean theories. If the bad taste about numerical
precision in our fuzzy, nebulous world lingers, I can point to
philosophical projects in other domains where the concepts we use are
sharply bounded, even though our ability to conceive of those sharp
boundaries or know them is limited, for example Timothy Williamson's
work on vagueness and knowledge as a mental state.

\section{Motivation for Indeterminate Credal States} 
\label{MotivationForIndeterminateCredalStates}

Booleans claim that it is rational for an agent to hold indeterminate
credal states rather than sharp credences, representing uncertainty.
They are Bayesians in all other respects and defend Bayesian
epistemology, proposing that it is better off without the requirement
for sharp credences. Laplaceans, by contrast, require sharp credences
for rational agents. We want to motivate indeterminacy as forcefully
as possible so that the reader will see (a) the appeal of the Boolean
approach, (b) the insufficiency of the critical response, and (c) the
need for careful articulation of the Laplacean approach that can
address the concerns which motivate some to resort to indeterminacy.
Finally, (d) the undesirable semantics of the Boolean approach,
documented both conceptually and by example, will lead to the
conclusion that a Laplacean approach is the more promising
alternative.

Let a \textsc{coin} be a Bernoulli generator that produces successes
and failures with probability $p$ for success, labeled $H$, and $1-p$
for failure, labeled $T$. Physical coins may serve as examples, if we
are willing to set aside that most of them are approximately fair.
Imagine three \textsc{coin}s for which we have evidence that
\textsc{coin}$_{I}$ is fair, \textsc{coin}$_{II}$ has an unknown bias,
and \textsc{coin}$_{III}$ has as bias either $p=1/3$ or $p=2/3$. The
Laplacean approach permits a sharp $0.5$ credence in $H$ for a
rational agent in all three cases. A Boolean approach wants to see the
difference in the evidential situation reflected in a rational agent's
credal state and for example at least permit, as credence in $H$,
$\{x|x=0.5\}$ for \textsc{coin}$_{I}$, $\{x|0\leq{}x\leq{}1\}$ for
\textsc{coin}$_{II}$, and $\{x|1/3\leq{}x\leq{}2/3\}$ or $\{1/3,2/3\}$
for \textsc{coin}$_{III}$. Here is a list of reasons for the Boolean
position.

\begin{enumerate}[(A)]
\item The greatest emphasis motivating indeterminacy rests on lack of
  evidence or conflicting evidence and the assumption that single
  probability measures (sharp credences) do not represent such
  evidence as well as credal states composed by sets of probability
  measures (indeterminate credal states).
\item The preference structure of a rational agent may be incomplete
  so that representation theorems do not yield single probability
  measures to represent such incomplete structures.
\item There are more technical and paper-specific reasons, such as
  Thomas Augustin's attempt to mediate between the minimax pessimism
  of objectivists and the Bayesian optimism of subjectivists using
  interval probability (see \scite{8}{augustin03}{35f}); Alan
  H{\'a}jek and Michael Smithson's belief that there may be
  objectively indeterminate chances in the physical world (see
  \scite{8}{hajeksmithson12}{33}); and Jake Chandler's claim that
  \qeins{the sharp model is at odds with a trio of plausible
    propositions regarding agnosticism} \scite{2}{chandler14}{4}.
\end{enumerate}

This paper mostly addresses (A), while taking (B) seriously as well
and pointing towards solutions for it. I am leaving (C) to more
specific responses to the issues presented in the cited articles, and
for the remainder of this section I am adding a reason (D) that is
poorly documented in the literature.

One motivation for permitting a rational agent to have a range of
probability measures rather than mandating her to hold a single one as
her credence is that she would do better making decisions and
accepting advantageous bets. 

Walley conducted an experiment in which Boolean participants did
significantly better than Laplacean participants, betting on soccer
games played in the Soccer World Cup 1982 in Spain (see
\scite{7}{walley91}{}, Appendix F).\tbd{check reference} I replicated
the experiment using two computer players with rudimentary artificial
intelligence and made them specify betting parameters (previsions) for
games played in the Soccer World Cup 2014 in Brazil. I used the
Poisson distribution (which is an excellent predictor for the outcome
of soccer matches) and the FIFA ranking to simulate millions of
counterfactual World Cup results and their associated bets, using
Walley's evaluation method. The Boolean player had a slight but
systematic advantage. In section \ref{WalleysWorldCupWoes}, I will
provide an explanation and show how it undermines any support the
experiment might give to the Boolean position. 

\section{Dilation} 
\label{Dilation}

Roger White introduces a problem for indeterminate credal states,
which I will call White's dilation problem, claiming that
indeterminate credal states lead to unacceptable doxastic scenarios
involving dilation. In dilation, there is a widening of the
indeterminate credal state upon updating instead of a narrowing
(especially Walley reiterates that more information generally means
more precision, see \scite{8}{walley91}{34}, although he also
addresses dilation, see \scite{8}{walley91}{299}). Sometimes this
widening is extreme, from a maximally precise credal state to a
vacuous credal state, based on little information (see
\scite{7}{white10}{} for examples). White's objection, even though I
think it fails as it stands, triggers semantic concessions on the part
of Booleans defending their position which will be important to my
semantic criticism of indeterminacy.

Joyce's response to White uses two lines of defence: the results are
not counter-intuitive upon closer inspection and Lewis'
indadmissibility criterion as well as two significant semantic
concessions to White show why the indeterminate credal states give us
the right result. I agree with Joyce: dilation is what you would
expect (1) if credences do not adequately represent evidence (the same
indeterminate credal state can reflect different evidential
situations); and (2) if indeterminate credal states do not reflect
knowledge claims about objective chances (Joyce rejects White's Chance
Grounding Thesis CGT, see \scite{8}{joyce10}{289}).

\addtocounter{expls}{1}

\begin{quotex}
  \textbf{Example \arabic{expls}: \addtocounter{expls}{1} Dilating
    Urns} You draw from an urn with 200 balls (100 red, 100 black) and
  receive the information that the urn actually had two chambers,
  one with 99 red balls and 1 black ball, the other with 1 red ball
  and 99 black balls.
\end{quotex}

xxyxx

Your credence would dilate, given this additional piece of
information, from a sharp $0.5$ to an indeterminate $[0.01,0.99]$
without much mystery (the indeterminate credence would licence an
unreasonable 99:1 bet, but that is part of the semantic criticism
below).

If one were to be committed to the principle of regularity, that all
states of the world considered possible have positive probability (for
a defence see \scite{7}{edwardsetal63}{}); and to the solution of
Henry Kyburg's lottery paradox, that what is rationally accepted
should have probability 1 (for a defence of this principle see
\scite{7}{douvenwilliamson06}{}); and the CGT, that one's spread of
credence should cover the range of possible chance hypotheses left
open by evidence; then one's indeterminate credal state must always be
vacuous. Booleans must deny at least one of the premises to avoid the
conclusion. Joyce denies the CGT, but then he continues to make
implicit use of it when he repeatedly complains that sharp credences
\qeins{ignore a vast number of possibilities that are consistent with
  [the] evidence} (for example in \scite{2}{joyce05}{170}).

When updating dilates the credal state, it appears that the prior
credal state was in some sense incorrect and did not properly reflect
the state of the world, even though it properly reflected the
epistemic state of the agent. Such a divergence between the proper
reflections of epistemic state and state of the world undermines the
subjective interpretation of probabilities at the heart of Bayesian
epistemology. An indeterminate credal state semantically blurs the
line between traditional full belief epistemology and formal partial
belief epistemology (for semantically more intelligible attempts at
reconciliation between the two see \scite{7}{moss13}{}, although Moss
is committed to the Boolean approach, which may weaken her case; and
\scite{7}{spohn12}{}, especially chapter 10).

White's objection fails because dilation for indeterminate credences
is in principle not any more surprising than a piece of information
that increases the Shannon entropy of a sharp credence. It is true for
both sharp and indeterminate credences that information can make us
less certain about things. We will turn to the semantic fallout of the
Boolean response to White's dilation problem now and show how it
brings into relief the virtues of sharp credences in responding to the
forceful motivations for indeterminate credal states while making
those indeterminate credal states look semantically otiose. Then we
will show in the last section how sharp credences have an elegant
solution for being outperformed by indeterminate credal states in
betting scenarios, and there we will rest our case.

\section{Semantics of Partial Belief} 
\label{SemanticsOfPartialBelief}

At the heart of my project is a proper semantic distinction between
evidence, information, and partial belief. Both sharp credences and
indeterminate credal states, within a Bayesian framework, try to
represent the uncertainty of an agent with respect to the truth of a
proposition. Indeterminate credal states have a greater ambition: they
also claim to represent properties of the evidence, such as its
weight, conflict between its constituents, or its ambiguity. 

The Laplacean approach uses partial beliefs about how a parameter is
distributed and then applies Lewis' summation formula (see
\scite{8}{lewis81}{266f}) to integrate over them and condense them to
a sharp credence. Walley comments on this \qeins{reduction} in his
section on Bayesian second order probabilities (see
\scite{8}{walley91}{258f}), but he mistakenly represents the Laplacean
approach as a second order approach, as if the probability
distributions that are summarized by Lewis' formula are of the same
kind as the resulting credences. They are not. They are objective
chances or other partitions of the event space and the subjective
probabilities that are associated with them. It is the Boolean
approach which has elements of a second order approach and thus makes
itself vulnerable to regress problems by adding another dimension of
uncertainty to a parameter (the credence) which already represents
uncertainty.

One of Joyce's complaints is that a sharp credence of $0.5$ for a
\textsc{coin} contains too much information if there is little or no
evidence that the \textsc{coin} is fair. This complaint, of course, is
only effective if we make a credence say something about the evidence.
Joyce himself, however, admits that indeterminate credal states cannot
represent the evidence without violating the reflection principle due
to White's dilation problem. He is quite clear that the same
indeterminate credal state can represent different evidential
scenarios (see, for example, \scite{8}{joyce10}{302}).

In any case, Walley's and Joyce's claim that indeterminate credal
states are less informative than sharp credences has no foundation in
information theory (see \scite{8}{walley91}{34}; and
\scite{8}{joyce10}{311} for examples, but this attitude is passim). To
compare indeterminate credal states and sharp credences
informationally, we would need a non-additive set function obeying
Shannon's axioms for information. This is a non-trivial task. I have
not succeeded solving it, but I am not at all convinced that it will
result in an information measure which assigns more information to a
sharp credence such as $\{0.5\}$ than to an indeterminate credal state
such as $\{x|1/3\leq{}x\leq{}2/3\}$ for a binomial random variable.

Augustin recognizes the problem of inadequate representation long
before Joyce, with specific reference to indeterminate credal states:
\qeins{The imprecise posterior does no longer contain all the relevant
  information to produce optimal decisions. Inference and decision do
  not coincide any more} \scite{2}{augustin03}{41} (see also an
example for inadequate representation of evidence by indeterminate
credal states in \scite{8}{bradleysteele13}{16}). Indeterminate credal
states fare no better than sharp credences, except perhaps for the
problem that they unhelpfully mimic saying something about the
evidence that is much better said elsewhere.

Sharp credences have one task: to represent epistemic uncertainty and
serve as a tool for updating, inference, and decision-making. They
cannot fulfill this task without continued reference to the evidence
which operates in the background. To use an analogy, credences are not
sufficient statistics with respect to updating, inference, and
decision-making. What is remarkable about Joyce's response to White's
dilation problem is that Joyce recognizes that indeterminate credal
states are not sufficient statistics either. But this means that they
fail at the double task which has been imposed on them: to represent
both epistemic uncertainty and the evidence.

In the following, I will provide a few examples where it becomes clear
that indeterminate credal states have difficulty representing
uncertainty because they are tangled in a double task which they
cannot fulfill.

\begin{quotex}
  \textbf{Example \arabic{expls}: \addtocounter{expls}{1} Aggregating Expert Opinion} You have no
  information whether it will rain tomorrow ($R$) or not except the
  predictions of two weather forecasters. One of them forecasts 0.3 on
  channel GPY, the other 0.6 on channel QCT. You consider the QCT
  forecaster to be significantly more reliable, based on past
  experience.
\end{quotex}

An indeterminate credal state corresponding to this situation may be
$[0.3,0.6]$ (see \scite{8}{walley91}{214}), but it will have a
difficult time representing the difference in reliability of the
experts. A sharp credence of $P(R)=0.55$, for example, does the right
thing. Beliefs about objective chances make little sense in many
situations where we have credences, since it is doubtful even in the
case of rain tomorrow that there is an urn of nature from which balls
are drawn. What is really at play is a complex interaction between
epistemic states (for example, experts evaluating meteorological data)
and the evidence which influences them.

\begin{quotex}
  \textbf{Example \arabic{expls}: \addtocounter{expls}{1} How Precise Can a Rational Agent Reasonably Be}
  Your sharp credence for rain tomorrow, based on the expert opinion
  of channel GPY and channel QCT (you have no other information) is
  $0.55$. Is it reasonable, considering how little evidence you have,
  to reject the belief that the chance of rain tomorrow is $0.54$ or
  $0.56$; or to prefer a 54.9 cent bet on rain to a 45.1 cent bet on
  no rain?
\end{quotex}

The first question, of course, is confused, but in instructive ways (a
display of this confusion is found in \scite{8}{hajeksmithson12}{38f},
and their doctor and time of the day analogy). A sharp credence
rejects no hypothesis about objective chances (unlike an indeterminate
credal state). It often has a subjective probability distribution
operating in the background, over which it integrates to yield the
sharp credence (it would do likewise in H{\'a}jek and Smithson's
example for the prognosis of the doctor or the time of the day,
without any problems). This subjective probability distribution may
look like this:

\begin{tabular}{|lcr|} \hline
$P(\pi(R)=0.00)$ & = & $0.0001$ \\ \hline
$P(\pi(R)=0.01)$ & = & $0.0003$ \\ \hline
$P(\pi(R)=0.02)$ & = & $0.0007$ \\ \hline
$\ldots$ & & $\ldots$ \\ \hline
$P(\pi(R)=0.30)$ & = & $0.0015$ \\ \hline
$P(\pi(R)=0.31)$ & = & $0.0016$ \\ \hline
$\ldots$ & & $\ldots$ \\ \hline
$P(\pi(R)=0.54)$ & = & $0.031$ \\ \hline
$P(\pi(R)=0.55)$ & = & $0.032$ \\ \hline
$P(\pi(R)=0.56)$ & = & $0.054$ \\ \hline
$\ldots$ & & $\ldots$ \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

It is condensed by Lewis' summation formula to a sharp credence,
without being reduced to it:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:s2}
  P(R)=\int_{0}^{1}\zeta{}P(\pi(R)=\zeta)\,d\zeta
\end{equation}

There are more semantic questions here: what is $\pi(R)$, the
objective chance that it rains tomorrow, and how do we get to use
$P(\pi(R)=\zeta)$ in our calculation of $P(R)$ without begging the
question. Lewis' 1981 paper \qeins{A Subjectivist's Guide to
  Objective Chance} remains the gold standard in addressing these
questions, and I will no longer pursue them here. The point is that we
have properly separated the semantic dimensions and that the Laplacean
approach is not a second order probability approach. The partial
belief epistemology deals with sharp credences and how they represent
uncertainty and serve as a tool in inference, updating, and decision
making; while Lewis' Humean speculations and his interpretation of
the principal principle cover the relationship between subjective
probabilities and objective chance.

The second question is also instructive: why would we prefer a 54.9
cent bet on rain to a 45.1 cent bet on no rain, given that we do not
possess the power of descrimination between these two bets? The answer
to this question ties in with the issue of incomplete preference
structure referenced above as motiviation (B) for indeterminate credal
states. 

The development of representation theorems beginning with Frank Ramsey
(followed by increasingly more compelling representation theorems in
\scite{7}{savage54}{}; and \scite{7}{jeffrey65}{}; and numerous other
variants in contemporary literature) puts the horse before the cart
and bases probability and utility functions of an agent on her
preferences, not the other way around. Once completeness as an axiom
for the preferences of an agent is jettisoned, indeterminacy follows
automatically. Indeterminacy may thus be a natural consequence of the
proper way to think about credences in terms of the preferences that
underlie them.

In response, preferences may very well logically and psychologically
precede an agent's probability and utility functions, but that does
not mean that we cannot inform the axioms we use for a rational
agent's preferences by undesirable consequences downstream.
Completeness may sound like an unreasonable imposition at the outset,
but if incompleteness has unwelcome semantic consequences for
credences, it is not illegitimate to revisit the issue. Timothy
Williamson goes through this exercise with vague concepts, showing
that all upstream logical solutions to the problem fail and that it
has to be solved downstream with an epistemic solution (see
\scite{7}{williamson96}{}). Vague concepts, like sharp credences, are
sharply bounded, but not in a way that is luminous to the agent (for
anti-luminosity see chapter 4 in \scite{7}{williamson00}{}).
Anti-luminosity answers the original question: the rational agent
prefers the 54.9 cent bet on rain to a 45.1 cent bet on no rain based
on her sharp credence without being in a position to have this
preference necessarily or have it based on physical or psychological
ability (for the analogous claim about knowledge see
\scite{8}{williamson00}{95}).

In a way, advocates of indeterminacy have solved this problem for us.
There is strong agreement among most of them that the issue of
determinacy for credences is not an issue of elicitation. The appeal
of preferences is that we can elicit them more easily than assessments
of probability and utility functions. The indeterminacy issue has been
raised to the probability level (or moved downstream) by indeterminacy
advocates themselves who feel justifiably uncomfortable with an
interpretation of their theory in behaviourist terms. So it shall be
solved there, and this paper makes an appeal to reject indeterminacy
on this level. Ironically, Isaac Levi seems to agree with me on this
point: when he talks about indeterminacy, it proceeds from the level
of probability judgment to preferences, not the other way around (see
\scite{8}{levi81}{533}).

\begin{quotex}
  \textbf{Example \arabic{expls}: \addtocounter{expls}{1} Jaynes' Monkeys} E.T. Jaynes describes an
  experiment with monkeys filling an urn randomly with balls from
  another urn, for which sampling provides no information and so makes
  updating vacuous (see \scite{8}{jaynesbretthorst03}{160}). Here is a
  variant of this experiment for which a sharp credence provides a
  more compelling result than the associated indeterminate credal
  state: Let urn $A$ contain 4 balls, two red and two black. A monkey
  randomly fills urn $B$ from urn $A$ with two balls. We draw from urn
  $B$.
\end{quotex}

The sharp credence of drawing a red ball is $0.5$, following Lewis'
summation formula for the different combinations of balls in urn $B$.
I find this solution more intuitive in terms of further inference,
decision making, and betting behaviour than a credal state of
$\{0,1/2,1\}$, since this indeterminate credal state would licence an
exorbitant bet in favour of one colour, for example one that costs
\$9,999 and pays \$10,000 if red is drawn and nothing if black is
drawn.

\begin{quotex}
  \textbf{Example \arabic{expls}: \addtocounter{expls}{1} Three Prisoners} Prisoner $X_{1}$ knows that two
  out of three prisoners ($X_{1},X_{2},X_{3}$) will be executed and
  one of them pardoned. He asks the warden of the prison to tell him
  the name of another prisoner who will be executed, hoping to gain
  knowledge about his own fate. When the warden tells him that $X_{3}$
  will be executed, $X_{1}$ erroneously updates his probability of
  pardon from $1/3$ to $1/2$, since either $X_{1}$ or $X_{2}$ will be
  spared.
\end{quotex}

Peter Walley maintains that for the Monty Hall problem and the Three
Prisoners problem, the probabilities of a rational agent should dilate
rather than settle on the commonly accepted solutions. Consider the
three prisoners problem. There is a compelling case for standard
conditioning and the result that the chances of pardon for prisoner
$X_{1}$ are unchanged after the update (see
\scite{8}{lukits14}{1421f}). Walley's dilated solution would give
prisoner $X_{1}$ hope on the doubtful possibility (and unfounded
assumption) that the warden might prefer to provide $X_{3}$'s name in
case prisoner $X_{1}$ was pardoned.

This example brings an interesting issue to the forefront. Sharp
credences often reflect independence of variables where such
independence is unwarranted. Booleans (more specifically, detractors
of the principle of indifference or the principle of maximum entropy,
principles which are used to generate sharp credences for rational
agents) tend to point this out gleefully. They prefer to dilate over
the possible dependence relationships (independence included). White's
dilation problem is an instance of this. The fallacy in the argument
for indeterminate credal states, illustrated by the three prisoners
problem, is that the probabilistic independence of sharp credences
does not imply independence of variables (the converse is correct),
but only that it is unknown whether there is dependence, and if yes,
whether it is correlation or inverse correlation.

\begin{quotex}
  \textbf{Example \arabic{expls}: \addtocounter{expls}{1} Wagner's Linguist} A
  linguist hears the utterance of a native and concludes that the
  native cannot be part of certain population groups, depending on
  what the utterance means. The linguist is uncertain between some
  options about the meaning of the utterance. (For full details see
  \scite{8}{wagner92}{252}; and \scite{8}{spohn12}{197}.)
\end{quotex}

The mathematician Carl Wagner proposed a natural generalization of
Jeffrey Conditioning for his Linguist example (see
\scite{7}{wagner92}{}). Since the principle of maximum entropy is
already a generalization of Jeffrey Conditioning, the question
naturally arises whether the two generalizations agree. Wagner makes
the case that they do not agree and deduces that the principle of
maximum entropy is sometimes an inappropriate updating mechanism, in
line with many earlier criticisms of the principle of maximum entropy
(see van Fraassen, 1981; \scite{7}{shimony85}{};
\scite{7}{skyrms87updating}{}; and, later on,
\scite{7}{grovehalpern97}{}). What is interesting about this case is
that Wagner uses indeterminate credal states for his deduction, so
that even if you agree with his natural generalization of Jeffrey
Conditioning (which I find plausible), the inconsistency with the
principle of maximum entropy can only be inferred assuming
indeterminate credal states. Wagner is unaware of this, and I am
showing in another paper (in process) how on the assumption of sharp
credences Wagner's generalization of Jeffrey conditioning perfectly
accords with the principle of maximum entropy.

This will not convince a proponent of indeterminate credences, since
they are already unlikely to believe in the general applicability of
the principle of maximum entropy (just as Wagner's argument is
unlikely to convince a proponent of the principle of maximum entropy,
since they are more likely to reject indeterminate credal states). The
battle lines are clearly drawn. Wagner's argument, instead of
undermining the principle of maximum entropy, just shows that
indeterminate credal states are as wedded to rejecting the claims of
the principle of maximum entropy as the principle of maximum entropy
is wedded to sharp credences.

\section{Evidence Differentials and Cushioning Credences} 
\label{WalleysWorldCupWoes}

After I found out that agents with indeterminate credal states do
better betting on soccer games (see section
\ref{MotivationForIndeterminateCredalStates}), I let player $X$ (who
uses sharp credences) and player $Y$ (who uses indeterminate credal
states) play a more basic betting game. An $n$-sided die is rolled (by
the computer). The die is fair, unbeknownst to the players. Their bets
are randomly and uniformly drawn from the simplex for which the
probabilities attributed to the $n$ results add up to 1. Player $Y$
also surrounds her credences with an imprecision uniformly drawn from
the interval $(0,y)$. I used Walley's pay off scheme (see
\scite{8}{walley91}{632}) to settle the bets.

The simulation results show that player $Y$ does better for $n>2$
while player $X$ does better for $n=2$. xxyxx A defence of sharp
credences for rational agents needs to have an explanation why for
$n>2$, player $Y$ does better. We will call it partial belief
cushioning, which is based on an evidence differential between the
bettors.

In many decision-making context, we do not have the luxury of calling
off the bet. We have to decide one way or another. This is a problem
for indeterminate credal states, as Booleans have to find a way to
decide without receiving clear instructions from the credal state.
Booleans have addressed this point extensively (see for example
\scite{8}{joyce10}{311ff}; for an opponent's view of this see
\scite{8}{elga10}{6ff}). The problem for sharp credences arises when
bets are noncompulsory, for then the data above suggest that agents
holding indeterminate credal states sometimes do better. Often,
decision-making happens as betting vis-{\`a}-vis uninformed nature or
opponents which are at least as uninformed as the rational agent.
Sometimes, however, bets are offered by better informed or potentially
better informed bookies. In this case, even an agent with sharp
credences must cushion her credences and is better off by rejecting
bets that look attractive in terms of her partial beliefs. If an agent
does not cushion her partial beliefs (whether they are sharp or
indeterminate), she will incur a loss in the long run. Since
cushioning is permitted in Walley's experimental setup, Laplacean
agents should also have access to it and then no longer do worse than
Boolean agents.

Cushioning does not stand in the way of holding a sharp credence, even
if the evidence is dim. The evidence determines for a rational agent
the partial beliefs over possible states of the world operating in the
background. The better the evidence, the more pointed the
distributions of these partial beliefs will be and the more willing
the rational agent will be to enter a bet. The mathematical decision
rule will be based on the underlying distribution of the partial
beliefs, not only on the sharp credence. As we have stated before, the
sharp credence is not a sufficient statistic for decision-making,
inference, or betting behaviour; and neither is an indeterminate
credal state. If a rational agent perceives an evidence differential
and lends some belief to the proposition that the bet is offered by
someone who has more evidence about the outcome of an event than she
does, then it is likely that the rational agent will update her sharp
credence, as she would do if she were informed of another source of
expert opinion. She will certainly not be willing to enter a bet based
on her outdated sharp credence.

The rational agent with a sharp credence has resources at her disposal
to use just as much differentiation with respect to accepting and
rejecting bets as the agent with indeterminate credal states. Often
(if she is able to and especially if the bets are offered to her by a
better-informed agent), she will reject both of two complementary
bets, even when they are fair. On the one hand, any advantage that the
agent with an indeterminate credal state has over her can be
counteracted based on her distribution over partial beliefs that she
has with respect to all possibilities. On the other hand, the agent
with indeterminate credal states suffers from a semantic mixing of
metaphors between evidential and epistemic dimensions that puts her at
a real disadvantage in terms of understanding the sources and
consequences of her knowledge and her uncertainties.
