Reviewers' comments:

Reviewer #2: This paper has some interesting ideas: for example there
is a nice and convincing defense against the argument that the axioms
on rational preference leave room for indeterminate probabilities. But
overall, I found the paper hard to follow, and wasn't left with a
crisp sense of what exactly is supposed to go wrong for Joyce's
defense. I also felt that the defender of indeterminate belief states
had more available replies than the author left space for - for
example, by saying that certain of the urn examples are
underdescribed, and that the intervals of indeterminacy are rather
narrow on some ways of filling in the details.
