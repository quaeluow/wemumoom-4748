Comments for the Author:

Reviewer #1: This paper argues that prominent responses to two problems arising for imprecise probabilitiesâ€”dilation and belief inertiaâ€”undermine the original motivations for generalizing standard probability theory in the first place.

Unfortunately, I find that the extent of the paper's contribution is unclear. In particular, it's unclear how much Au adds to the reflection-based objections to imprecise probabilities discussed in the Topey and White references cited. Furthermore, reflection is a *constraint*. The onus is on Au to motivate its extension to IP. Equally important, the relevant generalization is not, in fact, even precisely stated in the paper. Yet this is supposed to be the linchpin of the objection to the "Boolean" (one of the allegedly undermining positions proponents of imprecise probabilities take in order to respond to the problems mentioned above). This is not a minor complaint since non-trivial choices must be made to extend the reflection principle to the setting of imprecise probabilities, and such choices themselves require defense.

I also find that Au's discussion is marred by poor organization and unclear writing. For instance, on p. 5, Au discusses some formal requirement of Klir's without stating it. The discussion of this point also seems inadequate to warrant Au's conclusion: "I conclude about the Boolean use of inform that it currently has no basis in formalized information theory." After complaining about the numerous terms introduced for mathematical objects of interest to the theory of imprecise probabilities, Au bewilderingly introduces a novel term for credal states and uses it throughout the paper. On pp. 18-19, Au claims that the Laplacian enjoys certain formal advantages without describing them in detail.

I think there are also grounds to doubt Au's acquaintance with the literature on imprecise probabilities in general. For example, on p. 21, Au cites Levi as an example of "a crude version of indeterminacy that reduces partial beliefs to full beliefs." This is especially regrettable since Au does not understand the Levi line quoted. Au omits the word "direct" at the beginning of the quote, which signals Levi is talking about a particular form of inference. Namely, his own form of the Principal Principle, which the author seems sympathetic to in other places but confusingly calls "crude" here.

Finally, the methodology employed in the paper is unconvincing. The paper relies too heavily on examples (albeit poorly explained) whose upshots typically are far from clear.


Reviewer #2: I found this paper frustrating to read. In broadest outline, the plot is clear: the idea is that there are just ways to be a fan of imprecise credences---one of these (Bool-A) allows one to score points against fans of precise credences, the other (Bool-B) to respond to objections to imprecise credences---so if Bool-A and Bool-B are incompatible, then fans of imprecise credences are in trouble (their view is either unmotivated or open to serious objections). My main complaint about the paper is that despite this clear over-arching structure and despite the considerable wit and ingenuity of the author the paper is often meandering and poorly structured. Consider, for instance, the crucial opening paragraphs of Sec. 3.We are on p. 7, and we are finally to be given characterizations of Bool-A and Bool-B. But for some reason, the characterization proceeds by way of variant reactions to an example presented by the author--and it is granted that in fact, proponents of
Bool-A have more than one option available in responding to this example. It looks to me like the clearest characterization of the distinction between Bool-A and Bool-B comes near the top of p. 14. 

I also found the argumentation often quick and dismissive---e.g., in the discussion on the bottom half of p. 8.

At the same time, I found some of the discussion insightful--e.g., the framing of Sec. 6.
