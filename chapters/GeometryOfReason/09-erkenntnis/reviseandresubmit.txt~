I want to address each point the referees have made and indicate how I
have addressed it.

REVIEWER I

(xx) Making the argument more clear.

I have given the paper a more detailed structure and introduced
subsections. I have completely rewritten the introduction to clarify
and focus the argument.

(xx) Sections and their headlines should better guide the reader.

I have restructured this paper, especially the beginning sections, and
introduced subsections.

(xx) Adding a conclusions section is a must.

A conclusion has been added.

(xx) Clarifying the originality of content.

I have clearly flagged subsections whose results depend on other
authors; the characterization theorem for proper scoring rules is due
to McCarthy as well as Henderson and Buehler; the symmetry and
locality proofs are due to Savage, although I have expanded and
clarified Savage's proof. Continuity, regularity, and the Levinstein
argument are due to Levinstein. The remaining arguments and proofs are
mine.

(xx) Assessing the badness of failing.

I have introduced various references to Richard Pettigrew's book
``Accuracy and the Laws of Credence'' where symmetry is defended and
mounted a sustained argument against this position.

(xx) Adding a table with the different desiderata.

The table has been added with annotations.

(xx) Minor comments by first referee.

(yy) There are no longer sections with only one subsection.

(yy) The remark on page 3 has been deleted.

(yy) ``(0.5P+0.5Q)--this does not require a Euclidean metric.''

That is correct. I have added a clarifying note that Joyce uses the
geometry of reason in as much as he requires (0.5P+0.5Q) to be
epistemically symmetric with respect to its parents P and Q, which is
according to the symmetry argument by Savage equivalent to an
endorsement of the geometry of reason.

(yy) I have provided a definition of a simplex near the beginning of
the paper.

(yy) ``L&P-updating should be introduced before it is applied.''

I have rewritten the introductory sections to take care of this point.

(yy) ``I don't like the word "expectation". It makes people think about
expected val- ues. How about "desiderata", "properties" or something
else?''

This was a difficult point to address. While I understand the
referee's concern, I was not able to come up with a substitute that
didn't sound stilted, like the word ``desiderata.'' I played with
expressions such as ``desired features'' and ``desired properties,''
but in the end I chose to stick with ``expectations.''

(yy) ``Are these lists meant to consist of intuitive statements or are
the items natural language formulations of formal properties?''

I consider them to be expressions of epistemic intuitions that in some
instances can be formalized. Continuity, on the one hand, can be
formalized painlessly; the formal representation of horizon, on the
other hand, is an obvious artefact of the more comprehensive epistemic
intuition. I have given expression to the artificial nature of this
formalization in the revision.

(yy) ``CONTINUITY and INVARIANCE: these properties need
clarification.''

I have included the mathematical definition as well as a more precise
natural language formulation in the revision.

(yy) I have abandoned the terminology ``amujus.''

(yy) ``Page 11: Delete the sentence following (3).''

Done. This was an error in the original paper. Thank you for pointing
it out.

(yy) ``Page 12: Where can I find the "brief sketch"?''

I have clarified the terminology to refer to the immediately following
mathematical analysis of the Holmes example.

(yy) ``Page 14: "minimally inaccurate"--if one measures in their
sense.''

Quite right. I have reformulated this passage.

(yy) ``Page 17: "meant to be"--by whom?''

I have added a reference to clarify that I am talking about Richard
Jeffrey.

(yy) ``"It is called standard conditioning."--Delete this sentence.''

Sentence has been deleted.

(yy) ``Pages 28--30: A clearer structure of the argument would be nice
here. The use of the "proof"-environment or other such structures is
advisable.''

This is excellent advice. I have restructured the whole paper, but
also in particular this passage, using the proof environment in LaTeX.

(yy) ``COLLINEAR HORIZON: This has strong Euclidean appeal. I wonder
whether a "logarithmic" equivalent of co-linearity can be found.''

I have added the following paragraph to the revision:

The way I have formalized the horizon and collinear horizon
requirement is artificial in the face of the more comprehensive
epistemic intuition. Collinear horizon especially is dependent on the
Euclidean idea of collinearity. In a more integrated account it would
be desirable to have these requirements reformulated in a more general
fashion; convexity may play a major role in such a reformulation. It
could, perhaps, identify a divergence that does not violate horizon or
reveal why the divergence of information theory violates it. (I thank
an anonymous referee for bringing this point to my attention.)

(yy) ``Page 33: "the information required is infinite."--outright
impossible.''

Yes. I am hoping that is the impact this statement makes on the
reader.

(yy) ``Page 34: "escapes any epistemic intuition"--if so, is this soo
bad?''

I think it is bad enough in the sense of awakening intellectual
curiosity---why does information theory act in these unexpected ways?
I suspect there are answers to these questions (I am actively working
on finding them), and they could aid to find a more effective approach
to formal partial belief representation in general (such as the use of
differential geometry).

(yy) ``Make indexing consistent. Either always or never. I prefer to
always display the index.''

I would also prefer to display the index consistently, but in this
case I don't know where the index isn't displayed. Please clarify, and
I will correct.


REVIEWER II

(xx) Discuss proposed responses on behalf of the advocate of
LP-conditioning.

This is one of the major issues I have addressed in the revision. I
admit that I was not aware of Richard Pettigrew's 2016 book Accuracy
and the Laws of Credence when I originally wrote the paper.
Pettigrew's book is an excellent monograph on the topics covered in my
paper. It takes a strong position on symmetry and therefore provides a
perfect foil to highlight the contrasts in my paper (while also
providing a summary of much of the technical detail that is also in my
paper). I have completely rewritten the beginning pages of the paper
to address and respond to Pettigrew's account.

(xx) Expand on Leitgeb and Pettigrew's global/local inaccuracy account
as well as Benjamin Levinstein's ghost story.

For reasons of paper length, I have chosen not to follow this
recommendation. Instead, I have made sure that there are clearly
marked references to guide the reader to the literature. Leitgeb,
Pettigrew, and Levinstein's accounts are complete and well-executed,
so I did not feel a need to reiterate their arguments in an appendix.

(xx) Reorganize the introduction.

I have paid careful attention to this recommendation, as it was also
voiced by the other referee. I have completely restructured the
introduction, hoping that the road map for the paper has gained in
clarity and substance without adding too much in length. I have split
off a Features of Scoring Rules section in order to make the
Introduction section shorter.

(xx) Geometry of reason terminology.

I have amended the paper to make clear that the term geometry of
reason is Leitgeb and Pettigrew's.

(xx) ``Leitgeb and Pettigrew muse about alternative geometries ...''

I have cut this remark. It is obvious that Leitgeb and Pettigrew are
well aware of alternative geometries.

(xx) Prejudice for simplicity and starting with Euclidean geometry.

These comments are well-placed. I have addressed them in two ways: (a)
I have emphasized Thomas Mormann's assessment of dependence on
Euclidean geometry in logic generally. (b) In this revision, I have
more carefully identified Pettigrew's argument for
simplicity/symmetry. According to Pettigrew, there is a lack of
intuition whether the distance is from the ideal credence function to
the partial belief or from the partial belief to the credence
function. It is more symmetry than simplicity that makes Pettigrew
take the next step towards endorsing symmetry. Yet then, with these
kinds of arguments, there is always ``Symmetry and Its Discontents''
(S.L. Zabell).
