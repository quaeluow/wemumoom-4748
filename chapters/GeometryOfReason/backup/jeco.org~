Here is something interesting in Joyce that seems to appeal to the
same discomfort with LP's ``by the lights of'' that I had:

we cannot hope to justify probabilism by assuming that rational agents
should maximize the ex- pected accuracy of their opinions because the
concept of an expectation really only makes sense for agents whose
partial beliefs already obey the laws of probability. (Joyce, 1998,
590)

Note also that Joyce warns of equating accuracy with epistemic
utility, see 592. 

You may want to refer to Maher's criticism of Weak Convexity and
Symmetry in Maher 2002.

IMPORTANT notes in Schmierbuch, 1358--1364.

Some notes from 2015-01-25:

The asymmetry needs to be shown to be already there for standard
conditioning.

The midpoint between P(X)=0 and P(X)=0.2 is NOT P(X)=0.1.

How do you argue against the geometry of reason without assuming the
importance of information?

Is there a parallel here to Poincare Cassirer about the simplicity of
Euclidean geometry?

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

what is the epistemic benefit of using the ``geometry of reason''?

Here are some question collated <2015-01-18 Sun>:

(1) Show that JC is continuous with SC and LP is not.

(2) What is deficient about -\sum p_i log frac p_i q_i as a measure of
accuracy compared to squared? Consult LP I. Is there an analog in the
deductive case to using entropy as a measure of inaccuracy?

(3) Consider the immense information gain when some X_k's probability
is reduced to nil by LP.

(4) It makes a difference to LP whether you include some X_j in the
prior probability distribution whose prior probability is nil. Why
exclude those events -- they don't make a difference to JC.

This paper is a response to Leitgeb/Pettigrew. They claim that JC is
not minimally inaccurate, as their own updating rule is. My contention
is that their claim is implausible, since the accuracy of an updated
belief function needs to be measured by its own lights, not by the
lights of the now outdated belief function. Note the comments on the
hard copy of the paper. 

I did the calculations (Schmierbuch p. 1313) and it turns out that
their notion of accuracy is better than evaluating by the lights of
the updated belief function. JC only does slightly worse than the LP
rule. Here are the problems with LP: (1) why call their notion
``accuracy''? The virtue of accuracy is derived from the
propositional logic case, but the use of the outdated belief function
attenuates this virtue. It's at best accuracy-ish, it does only
slightly better than JC (contra their calculations), and it is NOT
continuous with SC.

there are notes on Joyce's nonpragmatic vindication on Schmierbuch p. 1349f
investigate Richard Pettigrew and Hans Leitgeb's criticism of JC based on rigidity, see ReadingGroup-FormalEpistemology
there is more on this now in jeco.org, the literature should be reviewed there as well

Skyrms has a Dutch-book argument for JC, but I don't know where (what about David Lewis's Why Conditionalize?)
