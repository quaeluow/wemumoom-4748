Leitgeb and Pettigrew present the following salient axioms (see
\scite{8}{leitgebpettigrew10i}{219}):

\begin{quotex}
  \textbf{Local Normality and Dominance}: If $I$ is a legitimate
  inaccuracy measure, then there is a strictly increasing function
  $f:\mathbb{R}^{+}_{0}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{+}_{0}$ such that, for
  any $A\in{}W$, $w\in{}W$, and $x\in\mathbb{R}^{+}_{0}$,
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:e4}
    I(A,w,x)=f\left(|\chi_{A}(w)-x|\right).
  \end{equation}
\end{quotex}

\begin{quotex}
  \textbf{Global Normality and Dominance}: If $G$ is a legitimate
  global inaccuracy measure, there is a strictly increasing function
  $g:\mathbb{R}^{+}_{0}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{+}_{0}$ such that, for
  all worlds $w$ and belief functions $b\in{}\mbox{Bel}(W)$,
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:e5}
  G(w,b)=g\left(\|w-b_{\mbox{{\tiny glo}}}\|\right).
  \end{equation}
\end{quotex}

Similarly to Joyce, these axioms are justified on the basis of
geometry, but this time more explicitly so:

\begin{quotex}
  Normality and Dominance [are] a consequence of taking seriously the
  talk of inaccuracy as \qnull{distance} from the truth, and [they
  endorse] the geometrical picture provided by Euclidean $n$-space as
  the correct clarification of this notion. As explained in section
  3.2, the assumption of this geometrical picture is one of the
  presuppositions of our account, and we do not have much to offer in
  its defense, except for stressing that we would be equally
  interested in studying the consequences of minimizing expected
  inaccuracy in a non-Euclidean framework. But without a doubt,
  starting with the Euclidean case is a natural thing to do.
\end{quotex}
