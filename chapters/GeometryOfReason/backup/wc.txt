Defenders of the epistemic utility approach to Bayesian epistemology use the geometry of reason to justify the foundational Bayesian tenets of probabilism and standard conditioning. The geometry of reason can also be used to justify a rejection of Jeffrey conditioning in favour of an alternative form of conditioning. The alternative form of conditioning fails several tests which Jeffrey conditioning passes and brings with it unacceptable results in certain cases. The solution to this problem is to reject the geometry of reason and accept information theory in its stead.
