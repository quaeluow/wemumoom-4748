Dear Dr. Lukits,

Thank you for submitting your paper, "Asymmetry and the Geometry of Reason" (BJPS-2016-115), to British Journal for the Philosophy of Science.

We regret to inform you that we have decided not to accept your paper for publication.  As you will appreciate, the Journal receives a large number of high quality submissions every year, and consequently competition for space in the journal is intense.  Some comments from our referees are attached and below, which we hope you will find helpful.

Yours sincerely,

Professor Steven French and Professor Michela Massimi

It is difficult to identify and assess the contribution that this paper makes because the motivation and importance of the work are not explained. It would be good to start by defining epistemic utility more carefully, explaining what it aims to accomplish and why the "geometry of reason" and information theory are taken to be the competing alternatives, and so forth. The key concepts of the paper as well as the mathematical terms and objects should be defined at first use. The criteria on Lists A and B should be justified, perhaps with examples included to provide more intuition. It is also unclear at some points whether the conditions discussed are standard in the literature or of the author's invention, and exactly how much of this work is newly-done by the author. I would recommend making the introduction and conclusion much more substantial, and using the introduction especially to clarify and situate the paper's contribution.

Related to this, I think the paper aims to conclude that the geometry of reason should be rejected, and information theory pursued, but I don't quite see where this conclusion comes from. Apart from outlining the argument explicitly in the introduction, it would be helpful if the argument were elaborated. As it is, the body of the paper just seems to show that both LP conditioning and K-L divergence satisfy some desirable conditions but not others. So the author should connect more dots in support of the conclusion. Perhaps more of a division between formal sections and prose argumentation would make it easier to track the argument.
