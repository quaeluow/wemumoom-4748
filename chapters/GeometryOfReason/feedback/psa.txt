Reviewers' comments:

Reviewer #1: This paper provides an overview of "Euclidean" and
"information theoretic" approaches to epistemic accuracy. It aims to
show that neither approach is wholly satisfactory. The former leads to
an undesirable form of updating, as shown by Leitgeb and Pettigrew.
The latter does not meet other constraints. While the author provides
some insight, the paper as a whole is not mature and should not be
published in Philosophy of Science. The constraints are mostly not
well motivated and often the results reported in the paper are already
well known. In addition, the analysis of Leitgeb and Pettigrew's
account of updating is superficial. Their updating rule is flawed, but
for other reasons than the ones suggested by the author. They fail to
see that learning takes place relative to a partition and not the full
algebra of propositions. Taking this into account in an appropriate
way would lead to the result that there is no conflict between Brier
score and Jeffrey conditioning.
