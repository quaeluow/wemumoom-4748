   Philosophy of Science
   Dear Stefan Lukits,
   While this paper has a number of significant virtues, I am sorry to
   report that it is not well suited for publication in Philosophy of
   Science.
   The reviewers' comments to the author are appended and linked below.
   Thank you for giving us the opportunity to consider your work for the
   journal.
   Best wishes,
   Jeff Barrett
   Editor-in-Chief

   Reviewers' comments:
   Reviewer #1: This paper provides an overview of "Euclidean" and
   "information theoretic" approaches to epistemic accuracy. It aims to
   show that neither approach is wholly satisfactory. The former leads to
   an undesirable form of updating, as shown by Leitgeb and Pettigrew. The
   latter does not meet other constraints.
   While the author provides some insight, the paper as a whole is not
   mature and should not be published in Philosophy of Science. The
   constraints are mostly not well motivated and often the results
   reported in the paper are already well known. In addition, the analysis
   of Leitgeb and Pettigrew's account of updating is superficial. Their
   updating rule is flawed, but for other reasons than the ones suggested
   by the author. They fail to see that learning takes place relative to a
   partition and not the full algebra of propositions. Taking this into
   account in an appropriate way would lead to the result that there is no
   conflict between Brier score and Jeffrey conditioning.
