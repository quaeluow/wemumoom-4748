Given a set of probabilities on an event space and a new observation, it is common to form updated probabilities by using rules of conditioning. Some observations pose constraints that cannot be addressed by standard conditional probabilities or Jeffrey conditioning. The principle of maximum entropy claims that it is then appropriate to form an updated probability assessment by minimizing information gain consistent with the observation. Opposition to the principle of maximum entropy leans heavily on a counterexample: the Judy Benjamin problem. The article shows that an intuitive approach, which on account of independence assumptions should support the opponents, turns out to support the principle of maximum entropy instead. The main target of the article are independence assumptions that opponents improperly apply to give the appearance that the solution provided by the principle of maximum entropy is implausible.
