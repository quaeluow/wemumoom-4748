There are very few things that need to be changed, and I am listing all of them here.

First, answers to your query.

(1) Please insert the following citation for Howson and Franklin: 

@article{howsonfranklin94,
  title =	 {Bayesian Conditionalization and Probability Kinematics},
  author =	 {Howson, C. and Franklin, A.},
  journal =	 {The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science},
  volume =	 {45},
  number =	 {2},
  pages =	 {451--466},
  year =	 {1994}
}

or

Howson, Colin, and Allan Franklin. "Bayesian conditionalization and probability kinematics." The British journal for the philosophy of science 45, no. 2 (1994): 451-466.

(2) Yes, please add “colour figure online” to the caption.

Here are a few more points that I am raising:

(3) Please change the sentence in the abstract:

>>Given a more general type of evidence than Bayes’ formula will accommodate, the principle of maximum entropy (MAXENT) provides a unique solution for the posterior probability distribution based on the intuition that the information gain consistent with assumptions and evidence should be minimal.<<

to the following two sentences (much easier to read):

>>Sometimes we receive evidence in a form that standard conditioning (or Jeffrey conditioning) cannot accommodate. The principle of maximum entropy (MAXENT) provides a unique solution for the posterior probability distribution based on the intuition that the information gain consistent with assumptions and evidence should be minimal.<<

(4) Please change my postal address from

to

Thank you!
