Given a more general type of evidence than Bayes' formula will accommodate, the principle of maximum entropy provides a unique solution for the posterior probability distribution based on the intuition that the information gain consistent with assumptions and evidence should be minimal. Opponents of objective methods to determine these probabilities prominently cite van Fraassen's Judy Benjamin case to undermine the generality of the principle of maximum entropy. This article shows that an intuitive approach to Judy Benjamin's case supports the principle of maximum entropy. This is surprising because based on independence assumptions the anticipated result is that it would support the opponents. It also demonstrates that opponents improperly apply independence assumptions to the problem.
