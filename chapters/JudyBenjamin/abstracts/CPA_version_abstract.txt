Given a special type of evidence, the Principle of Maximum Entropy
(PME) provides a solution for the posterior probability assignment
based on the intuition that the information gain consistent with
assumptions and evidence should be minimal. For one example (Judy
Benjamin) the results provided by the PME are supported by an
intuitive approach that prima facie should support the case of
opponents of PME; and independence assumptions rendering results
counter-intuitive are improperly applied by opponents.
