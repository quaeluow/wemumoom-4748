Given a more general type of evidence than required for Bayes'
formula, the Principle of Maximum Entropy (PME) provides a unique
solution for the posterior probability assignment based on the
intuition that the information gain consistent with assumptions and
evidence should be minimal. Opponents of objective methods to
determine these probabilities prominently cite van Fraassen's Judy
Benjamin case to undermine the generality of the PME. The article
shows that the results provided by the PME are supported by an
intuitive approach that prima facie should support the opponents. The
independence assumptions which render the results counter-intuitive
are improperly applied by opponents.
