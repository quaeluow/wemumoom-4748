Dear Stefan Lukits,

I am pleased to inform you that your paper, “The Full Employment Theorem in Probability Kinematics”, has been accepted for presentation at GWP.2013
in Hannover, March 11-14th 2013.

We have received many good submissions – so many, in fact, that we were only able to accept a mere 60%
of them – and are looking forward to an exciting conference. The organizing committee has based its
decisions on a double-blind peer review process, in the course of which each submission was
independently evaluated by two reviewers.

Registration is now open on the official website of the conference:
http://www.wissphil.de/gwp2013/regist.htm . Please register as soon as possible, so that we know
whether you will in fact be attending GWP.2013 to present your paper. (Also, if registering after January
14th, you will have to pay a higher registration fee.)

Thank you very much for contributing to GWP.2013.  We are looking forward to seeing you in Hannover in
March.

Sincerely,
Torsten Wilholt
on behalf of the GWP.2013 organizing committee
