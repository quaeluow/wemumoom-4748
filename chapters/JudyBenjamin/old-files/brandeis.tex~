\kapt{Introduction}

There are, possibly among others, three lines of attack against Rudolf
Carnap's conventionalism in geometry. Concise labels for them are
\textsc{quine/ holism}, \textsc{ryckman/relativity}, and
\textsc{mormann/topology}. We will give a brief summary what their
respective targets are and then focus on \textsc{mormann/topology} to
substantiate our claim that, whatever else may be said about Carnap's
conventionalism in geometry, it does not run afoul of mathematical
topology.

Instead, the objections of \textsc{mormann/topology} reveal that there
is an obscurity at the heart of Carnap's account of scientific
objectivity with respect to the practical limitations an empiricist
inquirer faces. For Thomas Mormann, it is clear that empiricists must
on principle reject any ideas that areas of the world are inaccessible
to empirical investigation. Carnap is less clear. On the one hand, he
rejects Emil Heinrich Du Bois-Reymond's \emph{Ignorabimus}. On the
other hand, his account clearly suggests even in his own words the
existence of at least singularities of principled ignorance.

\kapt{Carnap's Conventionalism in Geometry}

Carnap's conventionalism in geometry is the platform from which, often
by analogy, he launches into conventionalism in other areas. Consider,
for example, Carnap's comment in \emph{Der Raum} where the
transformation of a statement from one metric into another is
\qeins{aptly compared} \scite{2}{carnap22}{99} (page numbers refer to
the English translation of \emph{Der Raum}) to the translation of a
proposition from one language into another. Conventionalism in
geometry serves as evidence that not only are we able to express
topological facts using various metrics, but we are also able to
express the meaning of a proposition using various languages.
Linguistic descriptions and their underlying and underdetermining
propositional contents are in a many-to-one relationship, with no
privilege given to certain descriptions on the basis of how well they
express their meaning on a formal basis. Conventionalism in geometry,
although it is not referred to, influences the formation of the
principle of tolerance in \emph{The Logical Syntax of Language}
\scite{2}{carnap37}{52} (see \scite{8}{mormann07}{51}).

Conventionalism is not an incidental feature of Carnap's philosophical
pro\-jects, for instance in the \emph{The Logical Structure of the
  World} (from now on \emph{Aufbau}). For the \emph{Aufbau} is not
only after the reduction that later on was recognized to have failed
both by Carnap himself as well as his critics (see
\scite{8}{quine51}{37f}, \scite{8}{richardson98}{13}). A larger
project behind the reduction of science to logical form on the basis
of elementary experiences may be what Michael Friedman calls
\qeins{the most fundamental aim of the Aufbau: namely, the
  articulation and defense of a radically new conception of
  objectivity} \scite{2}{friedman87}{526} (see also
\scite{8}{richardson98}{90} and passim).

Objectivity raises both the question of intersubjective meaning and
the metaphysical nature of objects. Writing the \emph{Aufbau}, Carnap
proposes a unified answer to both of these questions. As there cannot
be meaningful intersubjective agreement on phenomenal content, which
is dependent on ostensive definitions, it is structural properties
which provide for the only achievable objectivity in science. The
metaphysical nature of objects is therefore a purely conventionalist
affair (one may speak about them from a realist, an idealist, or a
phenomenalist perspective), in which science can play no arbitrative
role, as there is no possible evaluative link between the different
\emph{fa\c{c}ons de parler} in metaphysics and observation.

More relevantly, conventions play an important role within science. As
the construction of the space-time world, visual things, and the
assignment of colour in {\S\S}125--127 shows, qualities are assigned
to point-instants \qeins{in such a way as to achieve the laziest world
  compatible with our experience} \scite{2}{quine51}{37} (see
especially point 11 in {\S}126). The problem what kind of simplicity
guides these conventions occupies Carnap already in \emph{Der Raum}
(where the rule is that \qeins{Einfachheit des Baues geht vor
  Einfachheit des Bauens} \scite{8}{carnap22}{82}, simplicity of the
construct trumps simplicity of construction) and receives full
attention in \emph{{\"U}ber die Aufgabe der Physik und die Anwendung
  des Grundsatzes der Einfachstheit} \scite{1}{carnap23}{}.

Whereas the project of reduction in the \emph{Aufbau} fails in
Carnap's later view (which does not necessarily mean that the project
of the \emph{Aufbau} fails, see \scite{7}{parks73}{},
\scite{7}{goodman77}{}, and \scite{8}{richardson98}{73}), Carnap
advocates conventionalism in a very similar form to his early
conventionalism as late as 1966 in his \emph{Introduction to the
  Philosophy of Science} \scite{1}{carnap95}{}. The conventionalism of
the \emph{Introduction to the Philosophy of Science} is as firmly
based on the evidence of conventionalism in geometry as the
conventionalism that we see in 1922 in \emph{Der Raum}. In a
\emph{Reply to Gr{\"u}nbaum} in 1963, Carnap explains that the only
reason he writes so little about conventionalism in geometry between
1922 and 1966 is that he feels Hans Reichenbach had already done all the
work in \emph{The Philosophy of Space and Time}
\scite{1}{reichenbach57}{} in 1928 (see \scite{8}{carnap63}{957}).

Carnap begins his philosophical work not as a logical empiricist, but
as a thinker in whom the neo-Kantian problem of the constitution of
objectivity by way of the synthetic a priori and its relationship to
advancing science (especially the theory of relativity) meets with
Frege's predicate logic and Russell's theory of types. Carnap's
position in the \emph{Aufbau} is characterized by a large-scale
attempt to replace Kant's synthetic a priori (which depends on a
transcendental logic itself dependent on intuition, see
\scite{8}{friedman87}{529}) by the logical structure of elements (see,
for example, \scite{8}{carnap03}{176}, {\S}106, and
\scite{8}{carnap03}{289}, {\S}179).

The essences of these elements, perceived by intuition, are no longer
of consequence to objectivity, because with the new logic their formal
structure can be rendered substantive without reference to phenomenal
content. (The notion that they are substantive means that they are
well-defined without reference to their metaphysical or phenomenal
essences but solely to the structural relations they entertain with
other elements, see \scite{8}{carnap03}{24f}, {\S}13. It does not mean
to say that science, despite its omnipotence in answering well-formed
questions, has to offer much insight relative to practical life and
its riddles, see \scite{8}{carnap03}{297}, {\S}183.) There is no need
for synthetic a priori judgments as \qeins{the conventional and the
  empirical} \scite{2}{carnap03}{289}, {\S}179, exhaust the
componentry of cognition.

This picture draws inspiration from the conventionalism conceived by
Henri Poincar{\'e} just a few years before the advent of Albert
Einstein's theory of relativity. Poincar{\'e} concludes from a result
by Nikolai Lobachevsky that experiment cannot inform geometry in the
sense of deciding between alternative, consistent theories (see
\scite{8}{poincare52}{70}). Lobachevsky showed that it is in principle
impossible to design an experiment that leads to contradictions if
interpreted in Lobachevskian geometry (or hyperbolic geometry, where
given a line and a point not on the line there are more than one line
going through the point that do not intersect with the original line)
unless it also leads to contradictions in Euclidean geometry. Because
Euclidean geometry can be shown to be consistent
\scite{5}{tarski51}{}, Lobachevskian geometry must be consistent as
well. (Lobachevsky's proof is not difficult to grasp: hyperbolic
geometry can be embedded in Euclidean geometry, and thus an
inconsistency in hyperbolic geometry necessitates an inconsistency in
Euclidean geometry.)

Considering that therefore no experiment will ever tell us whether
space is Euclidean or non-Euclidean, a convention will have to deliver
the constraint that no necessity of observation will impose on us:
\qeins{one geometry cannot be more true than another; it can only be
  more convenient} \scite{2}{poincare52}{50}. Poincar{\'e} comes to
the conclusion that Euclidean geometry is the most convenient, on
account of its simplicity and its sufficient agreement with the
properties of natural solids.

A few years later, conventionalism is put to the test by relativity
theory, which relies heavily on experiments to establish itself and
its non-Euclidean view of space geometry. Ernst Cassirer, from whom
Carnap inherits a deep commitment to the \qeins{logical
  differentiation of the contents of experience and their arrangement
  in an ordered system of dependencies} \scite{2}{cassirer04}{280},
now turns Poincar{\'e}'s argument on its head and justifies why
Euclidean geometry is no longer the most convenient geometry:

\begin{quotex}
  Pure Euclidean space stands, as is now seen, not closer to the
  demands of empirical and physical knowledge than the non-Euclidean
  manifolds but rather more removed. For precisely because it
  represents the logically simplest form of spatial construction it is
  not wholly adequate to the complexity of content and the material
  determinateness of the empirical. Its fundamental property of
  homogeneity, its axiom of the equivalence in principle of all
  points, now marks it as an abstract space; for, in the concrete and
  empirical manifold, there never is such uniformity, but rather
  thorough-going differentiation reigns in it.
  \scite{3}{cassirer04}{443}
\end{quotex}

With these dynamics at play, Carnap largely adopts Poincar{\'e}'s
conventionalism (sometimes also leaning on the more radical Hugo
Dingler, although later in life Carnap calls Dingler someone who has
taken conventionalism too far, see \scite{8}{carnap95}{59}) with a
renewed emphasis on \emph{critical} conventionalism. Critical
conventionalism notes that there are parts of physics which because of
their dependence on conventions cannot be verified or refuted by
experience, but also insists on the \qnull{critical} feature of
conventions which subjects them to evaluation along simplicity
considerations (for an example of this see {\S}136 in the
\emph{Aufbau}, \scite{8}{carnap03}{210}). Edmund Runggaldier writes:

\begin{quotex}
  Even though there is no possibility of phenomenal verification or
  falsification for some of the constituent \qnull{content parts} of
  physics, there are practical criteria for accepting or rejecting
  them. Carnap maintained, throughout his life, that conventions play
  a very great role in the introduction into physics of quantitative
  concepts of space, time and causality. \scite{3}{runggaldier84}{30}
\end{quotex}

\kapt{Three Lines of Attack}

This section does not intend to give a full account of the first two
lines of attack, \textsc{quine/holism} and
\textsc{ryckman/relativity}. They are only mentioned to provide
context for the third, \textsc{mormann/topology}, and to show that
disarming Mormann's reservations has no particular implications
whether or not we can make our way past the reservations of the other
two.

\textbf{(1)} \textsc{quine/holism}, expressed in \scite{1}{quine51}{}
and \scite{1}{quine69}{}, maintains that the strong distinction
between analytic and synthetic truths (held not only by Carnap, but
also by Moritz Schlick and Reichenbach, see \scite{8}{howard94}{47}) breaks
down upon closer examination:

\begin{quotex}
  For all its a priori reasonableness, a boundary between analytic and
  synthetic statements simply has not been drawn. That there is such a
  distinction to be drawn at all is an unempirical dogma of
  empiricists, a metaphysical article of faith. \scite{3}{quine51}{34}
\end{quotex}

This conclusion rests on considerations of synonymy and artificial
languages, both of which are shown by Quine to be of interest only
once we have already understood the notion of analyticity, and neither
of which help in gaining such an understanding. It is therefore a
matter of metaphysical commitment (which is precisely what a
commitment to Carnap's project must reject) to distinguish between
analytic conventions, which nail down (in Carnap's words,
\emph{festsetzen}) the necessary metric (or language) to facilitate
univocal structural relations that are receptive for empirical
evaluation, and synthetic a posteriori scientific hypotheses. Quine
identifies the hysteron proteron of Carnap's epistemological
categorization of science as the synthetic a posteriori, contrasted
with convention, and advocates in good naturalist tradition for
allowing epistemology the resources of science (see
\scite{8}{quine69}{90}). 

For Quine, the reductionist project in the \emph{Aufbau} is intimately
related to the \qeins{cleavage between the analytic and the synthetic}
\scite{2}{quine51}{38}, and once the former fails, the latter fails as
well (how this may not be the case, following Friedman, see
\scite{8}{richardson98}{73}). For our purposes, however, it is the
intimate connection between conventionalism and the analytic/synthetic
dichotomy that is relevant in Quine's critique: if the dichotomy
collapses under Quine's holism, then there is no room left for
Carnap's conventionalism, neither in geometry nor as it is more
generally developed in \emph{The Logical Syntax of Language}. (For
this intimate connection between conventionalism and the
analytic/synthetic dichotomy see \scite{7}{yuneznaude03}{}.)

\textbf{(2)} \textsc{ryckman/relativity} criticizes Carnap's
conventionalism in geometry on an altogether different level, its
relationship to Einstein's theory of relativity. It has been
articulated by both Thomas Ryckman \scite{1}{ryckman05}{} and Friedman
\scite{1}{friedman99}{}, although we will focus on Ryckman's version.
Ryckman skillfully locates Einstein's position between Hermann Weyl's
and Reichenbach's. At the time (there will be an ironic reversal of
Weyl's and Einstein's position later on), Weyl pursues a
\qnull{broadened relativity theory} seeking to explain rods and clocks
as derived from field equations and not \qeins{stipulated as
  independent primitive \qzwei{facts} licensed in the physical
  definition of metrical notions} \scite{2}{ryckman05}{79}.
Reichenbach, on the other hand, defends Schlick's new empiricism of
coordination between mathematical representations and concrete
physical objects, thus basing geometry on stipulations regarding rigid
measuring rods and uniform clocks.

Einstein is in this conflict squarely on Reichenbach's side, relying
on the work of the much younger physicist Wolfgang Pauli, who
identifies empirical contradictions in Weyl's work. Weyl's theory
predicts the perihelion precession of Mercury and the bending of light
rays in the solar gravitational field as well as Einstein's theory of
relativity, but it also turns out to predict, according to Pauli's
calculation, a widely varying spectral signature of hydrogen atoms at
far distances. Unfortunately for Weyl's theory, astronomical
observation confirms the homogeneity of this signature even at far
distances. Einstein had followed his intuition for \qnull{practical
  geometry,} which in his view had not been possible without the
assumption of rigid measuring rods and uniform clocks, and Pauli had,
for the time being, proven him right.

On another point, however, Einstein disagrees with
\qeins{Reichenbach's method of analysis that proposes to cleave a
  physical theory into its empirical and its non-empirical parts (to
  be designated, after the \qzwei{linguistic turn} prefigured in
  Schlick, its synthetic and its analytic statements)}
\scite{2}{ryckman05}{95}. For Einstein, it is the observation of
uniformity that brings about his empirical belief in rigid measuring
rods and uniform clocks, while for Reichenbach in his opposition to
Weyl they are postulates vulnerable at best to evaluation on
non-empirical grounds. This is also the breeding ground for a sharp
disagreement between Einstein's position and Carnap's conventionalism
in geometry.

\begin{quotex}
  In the general theory of relativity, physics and geometry are
  entangled in a way that geometric conventionalism had not previously
  envisaged: the metric of space-time is no longer accounted as a
  globally rigid structure, fixed for all time, but as dynamically
  dependent in a given region, according to the Einstein field
  equations, upon surrounding matter and energy distributions.
  \scite{3}{ryckman05}{78}
\end{quotex}

In a 1921 lecture, entitled \emph{Geometry and Experience}, Einstein
refers to Riemann's \qnull{audacious idea} \qeins{that the
geometric behavior of bodies might be conditioned by physical
realities or forces} (in \scite{8}{ryckman05}{91}). In Einstein's
later words, 

\begin{quotex}
  If we imagine the gravitational field, i.e. the functions $g_{ik}$,
  to be removed, there does not remain a space of the type (1)
  [Minkowski spacetime], but absolutely \emph{nothing}, and also no
  \qnull{topological space} (Einstein's emphasis).
  \scite{3}{einstein52}{155}
\end{quotex}

This is clearly not what Carnap has in mind, explicitly in \emph{Der
  Raum}, where topological space is a type of space to which
projective and metrical space stand in a relationship of species and
subspecies \scite{2}{carnap22}{17}, which is characterized by the
mathematical relationships of curves and surfaces lying in or upon one
another \scite{2}{carnap22}{45}, and which comes in three
\qnull{meanings of space,} formal, intuitive, and physical
\scite{2}{carnap22}{5}. Topological space is here not
\qeins{entangled} \scite{2}{ryckman05}{78} with metrical or physical
space, nor is physical space constitutive of it. On the contrary,
philosophers, mathematicians, and physicists are admonished to keep
them properly differentiated \scite{2}{carnap22}{95}.

Einstein's theory of general relativity is not at all what
Poincar{\'e} has in mind when he looks upon the alternatives of
Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries, with no empirical observations
to guide us in accepting one or another convention to apply to
physical space. General relativity theory integrates geometry and
physics, all the while remaining fully within the purview of empirical
verification (and shenanigans like Weyl's, which \qeins{renounce
  {\ldots} empirically-grounded coordination, {\ldots} rob the theory
  [of general relativity] of its most solid empirical support and
  possibilities of confirmation,} \scite{8}{ryckman05}{92}). 

Carnap's conventionalism violates Einstein's theory in as far as it
does not accept this commitment as part and parcel of the theory but
rather lifts the evaluation of the theory out of the empirical realm
into non-empirical critical considerations of greatest simplicity
(\qnull{Einfachstheit}). Cassirer's defence of non-Euclidean geometry
as applying to space quoted above is another example of this kind of
non-empirical verification. Ryckman's critique is effective in
locating Carnap at the same end of either misunderstanding the theory
of general relativity or disagreeing with it.

\textbf{(3)} \textsc{mormann/topology} picks up where
\textsc{ryckman/relativity} leaves off in our discussion, with the
question of how enmeshed topologies are with the metrics that can be
defined on them. As we have seen, Carnap suggests already in the
\emph{Aufbau} that Kant's division of judgments into synthetic a
priori and other variants of synthetic/analytic and a priori/a
posteriori judgments can be completely replaced by the conventional
and the empirical (see \scite{8}{carnap03}{289}, {\S}179). This is an
adumbration of how Carnap's conventionalism eventually culminates in
the principle of tolerance (for the principle of tolerance see
\scite{8}{carnap37}{52}), which considers even logic to be
conventional.

Carnap often justifies the conventionalism generalized to language and
logic by analogy to the specific conventionalism found in geometry.
Expressing a proposition in a natural language is analogous to
expressing a topological fact in a conventional metric. Translating
natural language sentences from German to French, for example,
compares to translating a statement belonging to one metrical spatial
form into another (see \scite{8}{carnap22}{99}). In Mormann's words,
metrical conventionalism is the paradigm for conventionalism in
general. Mormann's contention is that, whatever may be true about
conventionalism in general, the mathematical discipline of
differential topology does not support the conventionalism in geometry
which is Carnap's main support for conventionalism in general:

\begin{quotex}
  for purely mathematical reasons geometry fails to be a stronghold
  for conventionalism. One can show that Poincar{\'e}'s result
  concerning the metrical structure of Euclidean spaces is not
  representative for manifolds in general: differential topology and
  related mathematical disciplines of twentieth-century mathematics
  have shown that the relation between the topological and geometrical
  structure of manifolds is extremely intricate. It is quite
  misleading to describe this relation in terms of a hierarchical
  conventionalism {\`a} la Carnap, according to which there is a
  bedrock of topological facts (\qnull{topologischer Tatbestand})
  dealing with the topological structure of space-time, and then there
  are different \qnull{Euclidean} and \qnull{non-Euclidean languages}
  in which these facts are expressed. \scite{3}{mormann07}{51}
\end{quotex}

It is now up to us to parse what Mormann means by the intricacies of
the relationship between topological and geometrical structures of
manifolds. Carnap's guiding example is the compatibility of a
hyperbolic (Lobachevskian) and parabolic (Euclidean) metric with the
same underlying topology, provided by Poincar{\'e} (see
\scite{8}{poincare52}{74}). A swallow doesn't make a summer, however,
and so Carnap comes up with another example.

Let us agree on the convention that the Earth's surface has zero
curvature everywhere. Regard the Earth's surface as infinitely large,
with the Euclidean geometry of the plane holding everywhere upon it
(see \scite{8}{carnap22}{69}). Mormann's topological interpretation of
this claim is (using not Mormann's but Morris Hirsch's naming
convention in \scite{7}{hirsch76}{}, where $S^{2}$ is the surface of a
two-dimensional sphere)
\begin{equation}\label{carmor1}
  S^{2}\mbox{ can be endowed with a metric }l_{1}\mbox{ with curvature }K=0\tag{C1}
\end{equation}
% \eqref{...}

This topology, according to Carnap, does not contradict any geodetic
measurements or physical observations. He is not quite happy with this
example, however, because the metric $l_{1}$ must give preference to a
particular point in $S^{2}$, for example the North Pole. This
preference does not sit well with our requirement for simplicity.
Instead of postulating curvature $K=0$ everywhere, we have the choice
of postulating $K=k$ everywhere, where $k>0$ is the curvature
corresponding to the curvature of $S^{2}$ given $l_{0}$, the Euclidean
distance measure we are used to. Now we no longer need a privileged
point to define a distance measure $l_{2}$ for this topology (also
extending it from $S^{2}$ to $\mathbb{R}^{3}$), which has a positive
curvature $k>0$ everywhere:
\begin{displaymath}
  l_{2}(A,B)=l_{0}(A,B)(1-{\sin}h)
\end{displaymath}
Carnap does not tell us what $h$ precisely refers to except that it is
the \qnull{height above $E$} ($E$ is the Earth and the spherical
surface on which $l_{2}=l_{0}$). Whose height? As long as we do not
know, we can only measure the distance between points that are
elements of concentric spheres around the centre of $S^{2}$. 

We also need a postulate on how to measure $h$, which Carnap provides
with the following rule:
\begin{displaymath}
  \int_{0}^{h}\frac{1}{1-{\sin}x}dx=a
\end{displaymath}
where $a$ is the length of a measuring rod measuring $h$ transferred
to $S^{2}$. Again, Carnap claims that accepting this topology and
metric will not put us at odds with any empirical observations or
measurements. Mormann translates his claim in terms of differential
topology into
\begin{align}
&\mathbb{R}^{3}\mbox{ can be endowed with a metric }l_{2}\notag
\\
&\mbox{with constant positive curvature }K=k\label{carmor2}\tag{C2}
\end{align}

Mormann now provides a proof that, under suitable conditions, both
\eqref{carmor1} and \eqref{carmor2} are false. Before we evaluate the
impact that Mormann's proof has on Carnap's conventionalism, a brief
comment about notation: Mormann is inconsistent, calling
$\mathbb{R}^{3}$ \qnull{$E^{3}$} and $S^{2}$ \qnull{$E^{2}$}, not to
mention that neither of them are necessarily Euclidean. Carnap's
notation using $M_{1},M_{e},M_{s},l,\mbox{ and }l_{0}$ is hopelessly
confused. Thus the unfortunate introduction of a third notational set
in this paper.

\kapt{Completeness and the Empiricist Point of View}

One of the favourite pastimes of topologists is homology, which seeks
for correspondence relationships between topologies and groups that
are global topological invariants. To be a global topological
invariant, a property will always be shared by homeomorphic
topologies. The prime example of a homology relationship is the
fundamental group shared by homeomorphic Riemannian manifolds. It
counts the number of loops that a continuous path takes around the
manifold and divides the paths into equivalence classes. In the case
of the circle in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, for example, they correspond to the
whole numbers $\mathbb{Z}$ (see \scite{8}{hatcher02}{26}).

Another homology relationship is the assignment of the
Euler-Poincar{\'e} characteristic $\chi(T)$ to a topological space
$X$. For polyhedra, $\chi(T)$ is know as the number of vertices minus
the number of edges plus the number of areas (e.g.\ $\chi(T)=2$ for a
cube). The theorem of Gauss-Bonnet states that for a compact
two-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$ without a boundary (such as
$S^{2}$), the total Gaussian curvature is ($A$ being the area element
of $M$)
\begin{displaymath}
  \iint_{M}KdA=2\pi\chi(M)
\end{displaymath}

The Euler-Poincar{\'e} characteristic for an orientable compact
surface homeo\-morphic to a sphere with some handles attached is $2-2g$,
$g$ being the number of handles. Consequently, $\chi(S^{2})=2$, and 
\eqref{carmor1} is false.

Now let $M$ be a complete connected Riemannian manifold with curvature
$K\geq a>0$ (call this last condition (*)). Bonnet's theorem states
that then $M$ must be compact. Because $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ fulfills all these
conditions except (*) and is not compact, \eqref{carmor2} is false.
(Both of these proofs see \scite{8}{mormann04}{820f}.)

Mormann concludes that Carnap's conventionalism in geometry as it is
justified in \emph{Der Raum} is untenable because \qeins{there are
  nontrivial relations between the metrical structure and the
  underlying topological structure of $M$} \scite{2}{mormann04}{821}.
Topological spaces are not at all like propositional spaces harbouring
the \qnull{Tatbestand} (factual basis), which then is shipped out in
different descriptions depending on arbitrary metrical conventions.
The fact that a topological space can sometimes, as in Poincar{\'e}'s
case, be compatibly endowed with different metrics points to the
accidental nature of the example and not a relationship in which the
topological space is indifferent about the kind of metric we apply to
it.

What Mormann initially hides in footnotes (footnote 9 and footnote 12)
and eventually discusses in a section toward the end of his article
is that his idealized mathematical conditions do not necessarily match
the pragmatic constraints Carnap assumes to be true for the physicists
doing the work of finding empirical disconfirmation of physical
theories with respect to applicable conventions. In \emph{An
  Introduction to the Philosophy of Science}, for example, Carnap
tells the story of the ant physicists $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$, whose
\qeins{movements are confined to a limited domain on the surface of
  the sphere} \scite{2}{carnap95}{146}, and asks the question if they
have any need to quarrel as they give different descriptions of the
same totality of facts. $P_{1}$ maintains the theory that their world
is a spherical surface $S^{2}$, whereas $P_{2}$ maintains the theory
that it is a flat surface $E^{2}$.

Carnap then moves from the statement that \qeins{they cannot in
  principle decide which theory is correct} \scite{2}{carnap95}{148}
to Leibniz' declaration that, if there is in principle no way of
deciding between two statements, we should not say they have different
meanings. Carnap's claim warrants some head-scratching: is he using
the phrase \qnull{in principle} in a non-standard way? What if the ant
physicists (or their cousins, the ant engineers) invented jet
airplanes? If $P_{1}$ circles the sphere, $P_{2}$'s theory is
officially falsified. Carnap's \qnull{principle} includes the notion
of limitation, but how are we supposed to think of a principle of
limitation from an empiricist perspective? (For a fictional account of
what very small creatures can find out about very large creatures see
David Eagleman's story \qeins{Giantess} \scite{2}{eagleman09}{13--16};
for a real-life account of what very large creatures can find out
about very small, in fact unobservable, creatures, see the story of
Jean Perrin, Brownian motion, and molecular physics in
\scite{7}{salmon84}{}.)

Mormann clearly disagrees with Carnap on the admissibility of
limitation in empiricist inquiry. This disagreement, somewhat obscure
in Mormann's article, explains their mathematical disagreement.
\eqref{carmor1} and \eqref{carmor2} are not false, Carnap just never
makes clear that he admits limitations and the Riemannian manifolds
are therefore bounded or not complete (a space $X$ is complete if
every Cauchy sequence in it converges). Mormann complains that
completeness is \qeins{indispensable from an empiricist point of view}
\scite{2}{mormann04}{817}, that incompleteness \qeins{lacks empirical
  significance} \scite{2}{mormann04}{820}, that \qeins{it would be a
  desperate move to attempt to rescue Carnap's thesis by allowing him
  to fall back on incomplete metrics} \scite{2}{mormann04}{821}, and,
most relevantly, that
\begin{quotex}
  for an empiricist it is meaningless to be engaged in investigating
  the global structure of the world under the presupposition that
  large areas of that world are principally inaccessible to empirical
  investigation. \scite{3}{mormann04}{823}
\end{quotex}

In reply to Mormann, first off we need to note that completeness is
not the issue for \eqref{carmor1}. Let a plane $F$ go through a point
on the radius between the centre of the Earth and the North Pole (say
6000km away from the centre of the Earth) and be parallel to the
equatorial plane. Then define $T^{2}$, think of it as a punch bowl or
a spherical decapitated eggshell, as the intersection of
$\mathbb{R}^{3}$ south of $F$ (including $F$) and $S^{2}$. $T^{2}$
fulfills the conditions of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, and there is no
longer a problem with Carnap's claim that $T^{2}$ can be endowed with
a metric whose curvature is $0$, as Gauss-Bonnet's theorem for a space
with a boundary runs like this (see \scite{8}{chavel06}{260}):
\begin{displaymath}
  \int_{\partial M}k_{g}ds+\iint_{M}KdA=2\pi-\sum_{j=1}^{m}\alpha(p_{j})
\end{displaymath}
where $\partial M$ is the boundary of $M$, $k_{g}$ is the geodesic
curvature of $\partial M$, and the $\alpha(p_{j})$ are the exterior
angles of the corners $p_{1},\ldots,p_{m}$ of $\partial M$. 

Foreboding as this formula may look it actually makes good sense. Our
boundary (the intersection of $F$ and $S^{2}$) has no corners, so we
can ignore the sum of exterior angles. The concavity of the boundary,
however, makes up for the convexity of the sphere so that it is
possible to endow $T^{2}$ with a metric with constant curvature $K=0$.
You may ask why we did not keep $T^{2}$ open and exclude the boundary,
which would also provide us with the possibility of a metric with
constant curvature $K=0$. Such a space would be homeomorphic to
$\mathbb{R}^2$, very close to what Carnap had in mind, but it lacks
the completeness we were hoping for. In any case, $T^{2}$ as defined
is complete and fulfills Carnap's criteria.

Thus, when Mormann says that with incomplete metrics, while
\qeins{\eqref{carmor2} could be saved, \eqref{carmor1} remains false}
\scite{2}{mormann04}{821}, it remains false because we do not even
need to go as far as retreating to incomplete metrics. We can keep
\eqref{carmor1} by introducing a boundary, or, as Carnap would say, a
limitation. Carnap takes precisely this line of defence against
Gr{\"u}nbaum, who has reservations similar to Mormann's in
\scite{1}{gruenbaum63}{} (although Mormann dismisses Gr{\"u}nbaum's
argument, \scite{8}{mormann04}{819}). The limitation Carnap introduces,
however, is just one point: the projection point of the stereographic
projection. This limitation
\begin{quotex}
  has no consequences for any possible observational results, since
  every observation involves a spatial region with a positive
  extension, however small, but never a single point.
  \scite{3}{carnap63}{957}
\end{quotex}

This approach raises doubts. Reichenbach, for one, disagrees with it
when he notes that singularities, while admissible in topology, should
not be admitted in physics (see \scite{8}{reichenbach57}{80}),
although Carnap rejects this worry (see \scite{8}{carnap63}{958}).
Mormann's criticism is more to the point: should the empiricist accept
principled limitations to her inquiry? In Carnap's philosophical
world, this question is related to Du Bois-Reymond's famous
\emph{Ignorabimus} speech about the \qnull{Grenzen des Naturerkennens}
(1872).

Carnap addresses this question in {\S}183 of the \emph{Aufbau}, where
he pronounces that \qeins{for us there is no \emph{Ignorabimus}}
\scite{2}{carnap03}{297} because \emph{Ignorabimus} would mean that
\qeins{there are questions to which it is in principle impossible to
  find answers.} \qnull{In principle impossible} in the \emph{Aufbau},
of course, means that the map exhaustively representing the structural
properties of scientific objects makes the answers to the questions
indistinguishable (see \scite{8}{carnap03}{27}, {\S}15). It is unclear
whether pragmatic limitations such as those imposed on ant physicists
have the required impact on this map. Carnap asserts that in
connection with structural correlation properties, when we encounter
competing hypotheses, we can at least \qeins{indicate which empirical
  data would be required to decide in favor of one hypothesis or
  another} \scite{2}{carnap03}{37}. It remains unclear, however,
whether this set of data needs to be associated with an executable
task on part of the inquirer or not.

\kapt{Conclusion}

Mormann means to show that we do not have to go as far as Quine,
Ryckman, or Friedman, to reveal the weaknesses of Carnap's
conventionalism in geometry. A look at the mathematical foundations of
Carnap's claim identifies serious shortcomings. Consequently,
conventionalism in geometry is weak evidence for conventionalism in
general, but conventionalism in general is highly significant in
Carnap's lifelong philosophical quest for scientific objectivity.

Our claim, contra Mormann, is that it is not so much mathematical
inconsistency that is at the heart of this problem, but rather a lack
of clarity to what extent the limitations of the empiricist scientist
enter into which questions it is in principle possible to answer. Our
impression, unfortunately not based on a clarification by Carnap
himself, is that he includes practical limitations in his account of
the limits of science. To pose a question, Carnap says in {\S}180 of
the \emph{Aufbau}, \qeins{is to give a statement together with the
  task of deciding whether this statement or its negation is true}
\scite{2}{carnap03}{290}. If the task is \qnull{in principle}
impossible to carry out, which it very well may be (unless \qnull{in
  principle} means just the opposite of \qnull{in practice}), then it
remains open whether the question is properly posed.
