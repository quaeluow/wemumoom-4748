Richard,

This is a great paper. I will tell you further down that I think there is a fatal mistake in it, but nonetheless (a) the topic is very interesting---I've worked on this for a while now and find it to be a gift that keeps on giving. The more you dig, the more you find. I had never thought of your approach before, and to me it looks quite promising to yield something of substance. If you have any desire to carve out a topic and work on a paper together about the relationship between information and probability (or your project, to ground both of them in something more basic, like independence), let me know---I'd be game!
