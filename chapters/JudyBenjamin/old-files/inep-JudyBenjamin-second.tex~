This summarized the labours of the first half of the red book, numbers
in parentheses refer to the red book. We begin with a quote:

\begin{quotex} 
  Probability kinematics resembles ethics in the sense that there are
  all kinds of things we are able to say about the relations between
  our intuitions and the prescriptions or rules we propose. We never
  cease to be vulnerable, however, to the question why the states of
  affairs we describe should entail that we have one set of
  probability assignments and updating strategies and not another.
  That an observation or a piece of evidence should change our
  assessment of uncertainty with respect to relevant propositions and
  events in particular ways cannot be a matter of logical consistency.
  Even a Dutch Book argument rests on assumptions that are entangled
  with the relations and intuitions we are supposed to explain. Our
  task in this paper, then, is to show what were to flow from certain
  assumptions being made and certain intuitions being accepted, and to
  articulate them clearly and well so that we understand where they
  are reasonable, arbitrary, or subject to criticism. In all this, we
  never lose a sense of need for what ethicists in Rawl's tradition
  call a reflective equilibrium, as it is not the intuitions about
  particular cases alone, nor the general judgments they sometimes
  inspire, that carry away the prize, but rather a balance between
  them. The principle of maximum entropy is a poster child for this
  method: it is a principle with great generality and scope, arguably
  outperforming all others, but it also raises worries in particular
  cases. There is beauty in the fact that, as sweeping as the
  principle is, it cannot accommodate everything we think and feel
  about how conditionalization (another term for probability update)
  should proceed. This paper cautions, however, against undue
  enthusiasm about the full employment theorem, the view that
  ultimately all rules and methods of conditionalization are tools in
  the hand of a human inquirer, expressing that which one to use must
  always be based on the intuitive and creative labour of the user.
  Probability kinematics is not a sit-down dinner: various approaches
  mingle, easily shift positions, and have access to the buffet table
  from different angles. There is no throne even for the view that,
  when all is said and done, a special place remains for the art of
  human inquiry.

Let's assume a partition $\mathcal{A}$ of
$A_{1}\cup{}A_{2}\cup{}A_{3}$. Let
$\mathcal{B}\subset\mathcal{P}^{\mathcal{A}}$ be the collection of
sets which agree with the constraint imposed by (HDQ), i.e.\ 
\begin{displaymath}
  B\in\mathcal{B}\mbox{ iff }B=\{B_{i}\}\mbox{ and }t\mu\left(\bigcup{}B_{i}\cap{}A_{1}\right)=\mu\left(\bigcup{}B_{i}\cap{}A_{2}\right)
\end{displaymath}
