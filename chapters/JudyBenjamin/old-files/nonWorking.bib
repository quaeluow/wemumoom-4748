    abstract = {We introduce algorithmic information theory, also known as the theory of
Kolmogorov complexity. We explain the main concepts of this quantitative
approach to defining `information'. We discuss the extent to which Kolmogorov's
and Shannon's information theory have a common purpose, and where they are
fundamentally different. We indicate how recent developments within the theory
allow one to formally distinguish between `structural' (meaningful) and
`random' information as measured by the Kolmogorov structure function, which
leads to a mathematical formalization of Occam's razor in inductive inference.
We end by discussing some of the philosophical implications of the theory.},

    abstract = {This tutorial provides an overview of and introduction to Rissanen's Minimum
Description Length (MDL) Principle. The first chapter provides a conceptual,
entirely non-technical introduction to the subject. It serves as a basis for
the technical introduction given in the second chapter, in which all the ideas
of the first chapter are made mathematically precise. The main ideas are
discussed in great conceptual and technical detail. This tutorial is an
extended version of the first two chapters of the collection "Advances in
Minimum Description Length: Theory and Application" (edited by P.Grunwald, I.J.
Myung and M. Pitt, to be published by the MIT Press, Spring 2005).},
