\begin{abstract}
Two open questions of inductive reasoning are solved: (1) does the
principle of maximum entropy (\textsc{pme}) give a solution to the
obverse Majern{\'\i}k problem; and (2) is Wagner correct when he
claims that Jeffrey's updating principle (\textsc{jup}) contradicts
\textsc{pme}?  Majern{\'\i}k shows that \textsc{pme} provides unique
and plausible marginal probabilities, given conditional probabilities.
The obverse problem posed here is whether \textsc{pme} also provides
such conditional probabilities, given certain marginal probabilities.
The theorem developed to solve the obverse Majern{\'\i}k problem
demonstrates that in the special case introduced by Wagner
\textsc{pme} does not contradict \textsc{jup}, but elegantly
generalizes it and offers a more integrated approach to probability
updating.
