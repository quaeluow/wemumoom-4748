It is important to distinguish between type I and type II prior probabilities. The former precede any information at all (so-called ignorance priors). The latter are simply prior relative to posterior probabilities in probability kinematics. They may themselves be posterior probabilities with respect to an earlier instance of probability kinematics. Although Jaynes' original claims are concerned with type I prior probabilities, this paper works on the assumptions of Jaynes' later work focusing on type II prior probabilities. Some distinguish between MAXENT, the synchronic rule, and Infomin, the diachronic rule. The understanding here is that both operate on type II prior probabilities: MAXENT considers uniform prior probabilities (however this uniformity may have arisen) and a set of synchronic constraints on them; Infomin, in a more standard sense of updating, considers type II prior probabilities that are not necessarily uniform and updates them given evidence represented as new (diachronic) constraints on acceptable posterior probability distributions. Some say that MAXENT and Infomin contradict each other, but I disagree and maintain that they are compatible. I will have to defer this problem to future work, but a core argument for compatibility is already accessible in [13].
