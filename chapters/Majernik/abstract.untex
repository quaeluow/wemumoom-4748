Two open questions are solved: (1) does the principle of maximum entropy pme give a solution to the obverse Majernk problem; and (2) is Carl Wagner correct when he claims that Richard Jeffrey's updating principle jup contradicts pme ? Vladimr Majernk shows that the pme provides unique and plausible marginal probabilities, given conditional probabilities. The obverse Majernk problem, posed here, is whether the pme also provides such conditional probabilities, given certain marginal probabilities. The theorem developed to solve the obverse Majernk problem demonstrates that in the special case introduced by Wagner pme does not contradict jup, but elegantly generalizes it and offers a more integrated approach to probability updating.
