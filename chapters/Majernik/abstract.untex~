Two open questions are solved: (1) does the principle of maximum
entropy   pme  give a solution to the obverse Majern    k
problem; and (2) is Carl Wagner correct when he claims that Richard
Jeffrey's updating principle   jup  contradicts   pme ?
Vladim    r Majern    k shows that the   pme  provides
unique and plausible marginal probabilities, given conditional
probabilities. The obverse Majern    k problem, posed here, is
whether the   pme  also provides such conditional probabilities,
given certain marginal probabilities. The theorem developed to solve
the obverse Majern    k problem demonstrates that in the special
case introduced by Wagner   pme  does not contradict
  jup , but elegantly generalizes it and offers a more
integrated approach to probability updating.
