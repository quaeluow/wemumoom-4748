It provides the technical details for an epistemological companion paper, "A Natural Generalization of Jeffrey Conditioning," and introduces the obverse Majernik problem, which it also solves. The conclusions of the paper are directly related to the topic of the special edition. Neither the manuscript nor any parts of its content are currently under consideration or published in another journal.
