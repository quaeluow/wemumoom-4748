<p>
The paper studies a nice problem related to the application of
maximum-entropy principle (MEP) to Wagner classic examples. In
particular, it is shown that in the latter example MEP does not
contradict Jeffrey’s updating principle. This confirms the MEP as a
general criterion for dealing with inference in partially specified
models.
</p>

<p>
As a general comment, the idea is relevant for this journal. However,
I have found the paper too descriptive and lacking some mathematical
rigour in many parts. Therefore, in my opinion the author should
revise thoroughly its manuscript in order to improve its clarity of
exposition. More specifically:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The title seems misleading. I do not get the meaning of the use of
</li>
</ol>
<p>
the term “probability kinematics”. I understand that this is the same
term used in <sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>, but at least the author should clarify its meaning.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The introduction is too descriptive and has the structure of an
</li>
</ol>
<p>
informal speech. I would encourage the author to be more formal when
describing the related literature and the contributions of the present
manuscript. In particular, I would suggest: (i) a bullet list for
describing the contributions given in this manuscript and (ii) to move
the paragraph of paper organization at the end of the introduction.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Sec. II – About Eq. (2). It is apparent, after reading Eq. (1), (2)
</li>
</ol>
<p>
and so on, that a matrix-form notation is possible for the problem
under investigation. This would help keeping the notation compact, add
possible insights with respect to the given considerations and
understanding the structural differences between Wagner’s conditioning
and application of PME.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Eq. (2) – Please define carefully notation for the sum in the
</li>
</ol>
<p>
denominator.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>After Eq. (2): “I will soon introduce an example which makes the
</li>
</ol>
<p>
notation more perspicuous…”. Please avoid an informal writing style
(please change the entire paper accordingly).
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The sentence “Some distinguish between MAXENT, the synchronic rule,
</li>
</ol>
<p>
and Infomin, the diachronic rule, but I have shown elsewhere that the
two are compatible and both follow PME (see also <sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>)”. It is
necessary that you provide a published reference for such a statement,
or you just give clarify the meaning of this sentence. Additionally,
you should clarify in detail the difference the meaning of
“synchronic” and “diachronic” rules.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Pag. 4 – “I will do this in a more epistemological companion
</li>
</ol>
<p>
paper…”. First, this sentence follows an informal style which is
inadequate for a journal paper. Secondly, after reading the entire
manuscript, it seems that the present paper relies too much on the
mentioned “companion paper”.Therefore, I am asking whether it could be
useful adding part of the material (or even joining the two papers) in
order to make the paper self-contained.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Sec. 4 – About the definition of the so-called “joint
</li>
</ol>
<p>
probabilities”. According to notation in Sec.2, w<sub>i</sub> are simply coarser
partitions of the set of events given by &theta;<sub>j</sub>. Then, isn’t P(w<sub>i</sub>
&int; theta<sub>j</sub>) = P(&theta;<sub>j</sub>)? The author should carefully justify such
an aspect.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Pag. 5 – “ where x depends on your prior knowledge”. Again, this is
</li>
</ol>
<p>
too informal. I would rather suggest “…depends on the specific prior
knowledge”.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Pag. 6 – “…but maximize the entropy for the joint probability
</li>
</ol>
<p>
matrix M and the minimize the cross-entropy between the prior
probability matrix M and posterior probability matrix \hat{M} “. This
seems more a Kullback-Leibler divergence minimixization between M and
\hat{M}. In the latter case, the author should also explore possible
connections with well-known “reference framework” proposed by J.M.
Bernardo.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>“Other may want to sky the conclusion”. Please avoid such informal
</li>
</ol>
<p>
statements.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Eqs. (8-16): I am firmly convinced that this derivation is very
</li>
</ol>
<p>
important for the paper. Indeed I would suggest to use it as a
starting point and then show the compatibility of Wagner rule as a
case of MEP under a particular structural assumption (i.e. Eq. (14)).
The author can also help himself/herself in exposition following
analogous lines as in:

<p>
I have read the aforementioned manuscript with interest. I have to
admit in full honesty that this type of "philosophical" papers is hard
to be reviewed, since the recommendation is unavoidably influenced by
personal taste and "scientific beliefs", although the latter is a
contradiction in terms. These papers, according to my opinion, can
only be recommended for publication as is or to be rejected, since
there is no major research component that would justify a
recommendation in between.
</p>

<p>
Having said all that, I am a strong believer of not allowing
personal beliefs interfeer with science, and for this reason I
will recommend the paper to be accepted in its present form and
leave the editor make the final decision. I would however like to
provide an alternative point of view to the author, for his future
works.
</p>

<p>
In the paragraph in-between lines 116-123 the author emphatically
dismisses Wagner's conclusion that the PME is not a reliable
principle as incorrect. He relegates the support information for
his claim in another paper that he will write in the future, and I
don't doubt that.
</p>

<p>
There is, however, a different point of view, that says that
Wagner is correct. We have encountered several times problems
where PME is insuffient to describe and some communities know that
PME is nothing more than a postulate, a limiting case of the
energy and entropy production conservation laws. The most famous
community is the chemical engineering, where Prigogine proved that
higher-information systems tend to favor the minimum entropy
production as the principle that describes their response. A nice
and short review just got published in that community, that
summarizes these concepts. Although not entirely written in
philosophical-mathematical jargon, I would recommend the author to
read it for his future works:
</p>

<p>
E. Veveakis, K Regenauer-Lieb, Review of extremum postulates, Current
Opinion in Chemical Engineering, Volume 7, February 2015, Pages 40-46,
ISSN 2211-3398, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coche.2014.10.006">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.coche.2014.10.006</a>.
</p>

<p>
I wouldn't want to enter in a philosophical and endless debate on
which principle describes best what; I just wanted to emphasize
that the manuscript is written in a somehow imperative language,
which I consider not appropriate for a scientific topic that
torments the community for quite a few years. Therefore, maybe the
author wants to relax the strong conclusions and allow some
flexibility in his discussion. That aside, I wish the best to the
author for his future research.
