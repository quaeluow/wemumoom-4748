Carl Wagner proposes a generalization of Jeffrey conditioning to accommodate evidence in the form of conditionals. The generalization rests on a plausible intuition (W). Wagner shows how the principle of maximum entropy (M) disagrees with (W). I present a generalization of Wagner conditioning which is derived from (M). (M) does not only not disagree with (W), it generalizes it. Wagner only shows that one cannot hold (W) and (M) while rejecting (L), the Laplacean principle. Since all advocates of (M) accept (L), (W) and (M) are consistent. (M) provides a more integrated generalization of Jeffrey conditioning than Wagner conditioning.
