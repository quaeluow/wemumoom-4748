When we come to know a conditional, we cannot straightforwardly apply Jeffrey conditioning to gain an updated probability distribution. Carl Wagner has proposed a natural generalization of Jeffrey conditioning to accommodate this case (Wagner conditioning). The generalization rests on an ad hoc but plausible intuition (W). Wagner shows how the principle of maximum entropy (M) disagrees with intuition (W) and therefore considers (M) to be undermined. I argue that under assumptions that are natural to proponents of (M), (M) elegantly generalizes (W) (just as it generalizes standard conditioning and Jeffrey conditioning), far from being inconsistent with it.
