When we come to know a conditional, we cannot
straightforwardly apply Jeffrey conditioning to gain an updated
probability distribution. Carl Wagner has proposed a natural
generalization of Jeffrey conditioning to accommodate this case
(Wagner conditioning). The generalization rests on an ad hoc but
plausible intuition (W). Wagner shows how the principle of maximum
(M) entropy disagrees with intuition (W). This article presents a
natural generalization of Wagner conditioning which is derived from
(M) and implied by it. (M) does therefore not only not disagree with
(W), it seamlessly and elegantly generalizes it (just as it
generalizes standard conditioning and Jeffrey conditioning).
Wagner's inconsistency result between (M) and (W) rests on Wagner's
rejection of (L), the Laplacean Principle. The article explains (L)
and why all advocates of (M) accept it. Therefore, Wagner only shows
that one cannot hold (W) and (M) while rejecting (L). Since all
advocates of (M) accept (L), (W) and (M) are consistent and,
furthermore, (M) provides a much less ad hoc and much more
integrated generalization of Jeffrey conditioning than Wagner
conditioning.
