Ironically, I don't even think I am done responding to your paper.
What you say about epistemic entrenchment, Hellinger's Distance etc.
sounds super-plausible, but it's really incompatible with the
Principle of Maximum Entropy (not that you would mind, as you don't
subscribe to it). I'd say that philosophers who know something about
this are currently 99:1 in your favour that besides a probability
distribution one also needs to have some kind of epistemic
entrenchment in order to update probabilities uniquely following an
observation. This is especially well-articulated in Spohn's book on
ranking functions. It's almost like there is a first layer reflecting
my probability distribution and then a second layer reflecting to what
degree I am entrenched about these probabilities. If I want to defend
the PME, I must show that this second layer is really either part of
the background information or part of the new evidence. It is
evidential, not epistemological. When I say 99:1 I mean that I haven't
found a single philosopher yet who shares my intuition that the PME
does not need to be guarded (and constrained) by the labour of
epistemologists, epistemologists just need to understand it better.
But there are quite a few physicists ...

** use Sundowners at the Westcliff
see page 804 in Schmierbuch.

Sarah and Marian have arranged to go for sundowners at the Westcliff
hotel tomorrow. Sarah feels there is some chance that it will rain,
but thinks they can always enjoy the view from inside. To make sure,
Marian consults the staff at the Westcliff hotel and finds out that in
the event of rain, the inside area will be occupied by a wedding
party. So she tells Sarah: ``If it rains tomorrow, we cannot have
sundowners at the Westcliff.'' Upon learning this conditional, Sarah
sets her probability for sundowners and rain to zero, but she does not
adapt her probability for rain.

A jeweller has been shot in his store and robbed of a golden watch.
How- ever, it is not clear at this point what the relation between
these two events is; perhaps someone shot the jeweller and then
someone else saw an opportunity to steal the watch. Kate thinks there
is some chance that Henry is the robber (R). On the other hand, she
strongly doubts that he is capable of shooting someone, and thus, that
he is the shooter (S). Now the inspector, after hearing the
testimonies of several witnesses, tells Kate: ``If Henry robbed the
jeweller, then he also shot him.'' As a result, Kate becomes more
confident that Henry is not the robber, while her probability for
Henry having shot the jeweller does not change.
