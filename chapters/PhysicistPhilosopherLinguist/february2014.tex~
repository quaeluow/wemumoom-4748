This summarizes work done in February 2014. Sudelbuch around page 900.
The problem is that we have an $m\times{}n$ joint prior probability
matrix $p_{ij}$ with some zeroes in it (Wagner's constraints) that we want to
transform into a joint posterior probability matrix $(q_{ij}$.

For $p_{ij}$, we use the constraints and \textsc{maxent}. For
$q_{ij}$, we use the observation and \emph{Infomin}.
