You encounter the native of a certain foreign country and wonder whether he is a Catholic northerner, a Catholic southerner, a Protestant northerner, or a Protestant southerner. Your prior probability over these possibilities (based, say, on population statistics and the judgment that it is reasonable to regard this individual as a random representative of his country) is (0.2,0.3,0.4,0.1), respectively. The individual now utters a phrase in his native tongue which, due to the aural similarity of the phrases in question, might be a traditional Catholic piety, an epithet uncomplimentary to Protestants, an innocuous southern regionalism, or a slang expression used throughout the country in question. After reflecting on the matter you assign subjective probabilities (0.4,0.3,0.2,0.1), respectively, to these alternatives. In the light of this new evidence how should you revise your prior probabilties for the identity of the native?
