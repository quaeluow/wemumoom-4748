When we come to know a conditional, we cannot straightforwardly apply Jeffrey conditioning to gain an updated probability distribution. Carl Wagner has proposed a natural generalization of Jeffrey conditioning to accommodate this case (Wagner conditioning). The generalization rests on an ad hoc but plausible intuition (W). Wagner shows how the principle of maximum entropy disagrees with this intuition, thus casting further doubt on the principle of maximum entropy as an objective updating mechanism that generalizes Jeffrey conditioning.

  This article presents a natural generalization of Wagner conditioning (therefore also a natural generalization of Jeffrey conditioning) which is derived from the principle of maximum entropy and implied by it. The principle of maximum entropy does therefore not only not disagree with Wagner's plausible intuition, it seamlessly and elegantly generalizes it (just as it seamlessly and elegantly generalizes standard conditioning and Jeffrey conditioning). Wagner's inconsistency result between the principle of maximum entropy and his plausible intuition rests on Wagner's rejection of (L), the Laplacean Principle. The article explains (L) and why all advocates of the principle of maximum entropy accept it. Therefore, Wagner only shows that one cannot hold (W) and (M) while rejecting (L). Since all advocates of (M) accept (L), (W) and (M) are consistent and, furthermore, (M) provides a much less ad hoc and much more integrated generalization of Jeffrey conditioning than Wagner conditioning.
