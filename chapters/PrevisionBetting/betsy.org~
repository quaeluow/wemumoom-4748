** Weatherson
Brian Weatherson's ``Barry, Beth, and the demon.'' Prevision betting
provides a more mundane example where the offer of a bet influences
your credence. I may believe that Coca Cola stock should be at 75
cents, but when I find out that it is at 75 cents (or even cheaper), I
decide not to buy it because I know that the experts will hose me.
** Klir
Klir lists 6 reasons to accept imprecision in
\scite{8}{klir06}{129--133}. You could say that all of these have been
addressed in Augustin's Concession except (4), which is about
prevision betting as in Walley.
