<para>From now on, I will no longer make reference to the full employment theorems in computer science, which only provide us with a suggestive metaphor for what is at stake in epistemology. The full employment in probability kinematics is the position that intuitions about particular cases are necessary in order to find epistemically justified solutions to certain updating problems for partial beliefs. These intuitions cannot be contained by general updating procedures.</para>

<para>I have so far used the term `intuition' without much reflection what its role is in the justification of epistemic norms. There is a sense in which this dissertation is subject to a certain tension with respect to intuitions: on the one hand, I express skepticism about the intuitions on which the full employment theorem relies when it gives primacy to the epistemologist's intuitions about particular cases over general updating procedures. On the other hand, I repeatedly take recourse to intuitions to defend my own approach.</para>

<para>There are two types of intuitions at play. The first type concerns our views about the plausibility of rules and their implications on particular cases. The second type is restricted to particular cases and by definition escapes the general rule. My argument is skeptical towards the second type. The first type is what gets our thinking about the justification of epistemic norms off the ground in so far as these norms are ampliative with respect to logical coherence. First type intuitions are as necessary in epistemic justification as axioms are in mathematics, but they also share with axioms that it is a fruitful endeavour to consider varying sets of intuitions, what their logical consequences are, and how these consequences square with other intuitions we might have.</para>
