Alan,

I am nearing my prospectus defence (sometime in April, probably towards the end). I want to ask you if you would be willing to look at my prospectus draft and think about joining my examination/thesis committee. There is a strong formal component to my thesis, in which I am trying to work towards some rehabilition of information theory in probability kinematics. The deeper epistemological questions are about graded belief versus acceptance; the role of formal methods in probabilistic belief revision; and objectivity in responding to evidence. I would love to have you on board for this project.

Here is a taste of a paper that might make it into my thesis as a sub-chapter:

If you are inclined to look into this, I can give you a hardcopy of my prospectus draft on Saturday at the Spring Colloquium (I can send a softcopy as well).
