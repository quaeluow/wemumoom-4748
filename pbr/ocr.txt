Against this, a rule like cross-entropy seems extremely
attractive.  It provides a single 6enerd recipe w_ic_
can be _ec_anically applied to a huge space af up-
dates.  Even families of rules, such as van Fraassen
proposes, are not so bad= atter o_e _as cbose_ a rule
(usualJy by selecti_g a si_gle real-valued para_eter
[U_nh 1995]), the rest is a_ain mechanicd, general,
and determi_ate. Furtber_ore, all tbese rules work i_
t_e original space S, vit_aut requiring expansian, and
so may be more practical in a computational sense.

Since all we da in t_is. paper is a_dme nne particular
proble_, we _ust be careful in _aking ge_erd state
me_ts o_ t_e basis of our results. _evert_eless, tbey

"right'' way to update, especidly in an inco_pletely
speci_ed situation, is to think very carefully 6bout the
reaJ _ature and origin of t_e infor_ation we receive,
a_d then (try ta7 do whatever is necessary to _nd a

wisb far ane, a generaIIy satisfactary _ech_ical rule
such as cross-entropy, wbich saves us all tbis questian-
ing and warh, probably does not exist.
